      <P>(2) For purposes of this section, a pseudonym is a wholly fictitious name which does not represent the name of an actual contributor to a committee.</P>

      <P>(g) <E T="03">Building funds.</E> Gifts, subscriptions, loans, advances, deposits of money or anything of value made to defray costs of construction or purchase of office facilities received by a political committee in accordance with 11 CFR 100.7(b)(12) shall be reported as a memo entry on Schedule A.</P>

      <P>(i) <E T="03">Cumulative reports.</E> The reports required to be filed under 11 CFR 104.5 shall be cumulative for the calendar year to which they relate, but if there has been no change in a category reported in a previous report during that year, only the amount thereof need be carried forward.</P>

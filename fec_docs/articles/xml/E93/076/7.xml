        <P>On September 18, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit (&#x201C;DC Circuit Court&#x201D;) ruled that 11 CFR 100.57, 106.6(c), and 106.6(f) violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.<E T="03">See EMILY's List</E>v.<E T="03">FEC,</E>581 F.3d 1 (DC Cir. 2009). The court also ruled that 11 CFR 100.57 and 106.6(f), as well as one provision of 106.6(c), exceeded the Commission's authority under the Federal Election Campaign Act (&#x201C;Act&#x201D;).<E T="03">See id.</E>At the direction of the DC Circuit Court, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered that these rules are vacated.<E T="03">See Final Order, EMILY's List</E>v.<E T="03">FEC,</E>No. 05-0049 (D.DC Nov. 30, 2009). The Commission is now inserting a note to 11 CFR 100.57, 106.6(c), and 106.6(f) that reflects this court order.</P>

        <P>The Commission will issue a separate notice of rulemaking document to implement the court's order vacating 11 CFR 100.57, 106.6(c), and 106.6(f) from the regulations pursuant to the<E T="03">EMILY's List</E>decision. The Commission is first inserting a note to give the public immediate guidance that these provisions were vacated by court order while the Commission completes the rulemaking process of implementing the<E T="03">EMILY's List</E>decision.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Administrative Procedure Act</HD>
        <P>The Commission is issuing this rule as an interim final rule. This interim final rule will take effect immediately upon publication in the Federal Register. The public nonetheless may comment on this interim final rule and the Commission may address any comments received in a later rulemaking document.</P>

        <P>The Administrative Procedure Act (&#x201C;APA&#x201D;) requires an agency promulgating regulations to publish a notice of a proposed rulemaking in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. 5 U.S.C. 553(b). The notice and comment requirement does not apply, however, &#x201C;when the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefore in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.&#x201D; 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). The notice and comment requirement in this case is unnecessary because the Commission action is merely to insert language reciting the fact that the DC District Court has ordered that the aforementioned regulations are vacated. The result of the court's order is that neither public notice nor a comment period is likely to benefit the Commission in this rulemaking. This interim final rule is merely an informational amendment indicating that a court has issued an order concerning these rules.</P>

        <P>Moreover, the notice and comment period may be contrary to the public interest. The Commission notes that the 2010 elections for Federal office are scheduled to begin as early as February 2010, when some States begin holding their primary elections. The State of Illinois, for example, will hold its 2010 primary election on February 2, 2010.<E T="03">See http://www.elections.il.gov/Votinginformation/2010GPGE.aspx.</E>It is urgent, therefore, to give immediate notice to the public that these rules have been vacated by court order. The additional delay that would be incurred by providing notice and an opportunity to comment could be contrary to the public interest.</P>
        <P>For the same reasons, this interim final rule is not subject to the APA's thirty day delayed effective date requirement under the &#x201C;good cause&#x201D; exemption to the delayed effective date requirement. 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>

        <P>Because this interim final rule is exempt from the notice and comment procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b), the Commission is not required to conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis under 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604 (Regulatory Flexibility Act).<E T="03">See</E>5 U.S.C. 601(2) and 604(a).</P>

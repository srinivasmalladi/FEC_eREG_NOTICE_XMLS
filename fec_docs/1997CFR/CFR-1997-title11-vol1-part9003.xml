      <P>(c) <E T="03">All candidates.</E> To be eligible to receive any payment under 11 CFR 9004.2, <PRTPAGE P="194"/>the Presidential candidate of each major, minor or new party shall certify to the Commission, under penalty of perjury, that such candidate will not knowingly make expenditures from his or her personal funds, or the personal funds of his or her immediate family, in connection with his or her campaign for the office of President in excess of $50,000 in the aggregate.</P>
      <P>(1) For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">immediate family</E> means a candidate's spouse, and any child, parent, grandparent, brother, half-brother, sister, or half-sister of the candidate, and the spouses of such persons.</P>
      <P>(2) Expenditures from personal funds made under this paragraph shall not apply against the expenditure limitations.</P>
      <P>(3) For purposes of this section, the terms <E T="03">personal funds</E> and <E T="03">personal funds of his or her immediate family</E> mean:</P>
      <P>(i) Any assets which, under applicable state law, at the time he or she became a candidate, the candidate had legal right of access to or control over, and with respect to which the candidate had either:</P>
      <P>(A) Legal and rightful title, or</P>
      <P>(B) An equitable interest.</P>
      <P>(ii) Salary and other earned income from bona fide employment; dividends and proceeds from the sale of the candidate's stocks or other investments; bequests to the candidate; income from trusts established before candidacy; income from trusts established by bequest after candidacy of which the candidate is a beneficiary; gifts of a personal nature which had been customarily received prior to candidacy; proceeds from lotteries and similar legal games of chance.</P>
      <P>(iii) A candidate may use a portion of assets jointly owned with his or her spouse as personal funds.

Any contribution that is designated in writing or redesignated for the GELAC shall not be matched pursuant to 11 CFR 9034.2.</P>
      <P>(ii)(A) Contributions made during the matching payment period that do not exceed the contributor's limit for the primary election may be redesignated for the GELAC and subsequently transferred to the GELAC before the nomination only if—</P>
      <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The contributions represent funds in excess of any amount needed to pay remaining primary expenses;</P>
      <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The contributions have not been submitted for matching;</P>

Such contributions need not be redesignated by the contributors for the GELAC.</P>
      <P>(iv) Contributions that are made after the beginning of the expenditure report period but which are not designated in writing for the GELAC may be redesignated for the GELAC and transferred to the GELAC only if—</P>

      <P>(A) The contribution is made by check, money order, or other negotiable instrument which clearly indicates that it is made with respect to the GELAC; or</P>
      <P>(B) The contribution is accompanied by a writing, signed by the contributor, which clearly indicates that it is made with respect to the GELAC.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Uses.</E> (i) Contributions to the GELAC shall be used only for the following purposes:</P>

      <P>(C) To defray any civil or criminal penalties imposed pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 437g or 26 U.S.C. 9012;</P>
      <P>(D) To make repayments under 11 CFR 9007.2;</P>
      <P>(E) To defray the cost of soliciting contributions to the GELAC;</P>
      <P>(F) To defray the cost of producing, delivering and explaining the computerized information and materials provided pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.6 and explaining the operation of the computer system's software;</P>
      <P>(G) To make a loan to an account established pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.4 to defray qualified campaign expenses incurred prior to the expenditure report period or prior to receipt of Federal funds, provided that the amounts so loaned are restored to the GELAC; and</P>
      <P>(H) To defray unreimbursed costs incurred in providing transportation and services for the Secret Service and national security staff pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.6.</P>
      <P>(ii)(A) Expenditures for payroll (including payroll taxes), overhead and computer services, a portion of which are related to ensuring compliance with Title 2 of the United States Code and Chapter 95 of Title 26 of the United States Code, shall be initially paid from the candidate's Federal fund account under 11 CFR 9005.2 and may be later reimbursed by the compliance fund. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a candidate may use contributions to the GELAC to reimburse his or her Federal fund account an amount equal to 10% of the payroll and overhead expenditures of his or her national campaign headquarters and state offices.</P>
      <P>(B) Overhead expenditures include, but are not limited to rent, utilities, office equipment, furniture, supplies and all telephone charges except for telephone charges related to a special use such as voter registration and get out the vote efforts.</P>
      <P>(C) If the candidate wishes to claim a larger compliance exemption for payroll or overhead expenditures, the candidate shall establish allocation percentages for each individual who spends all or a portion of his or her time to perform duties which are considered necessary to ensure compliance with title 2 of the United States Code or chapter 95 of title 26 of the United States Code. The candidate shall keep detailed records to support the derivation of each percentage. Such records shall indicate which duties are considered compliance and the percentage of time each person spends on such activity.</P>
      <P>(D) In addition, a candidate may use contributions to the GELAC to reimburse his or her Federal fund account an amount equal to 50% of the costs (other than payroll) associated with computer services. Such costs include but are not limited to rental and maintenance of computer equipment, data entry services not performed by committee personnel, and related supplies.</P>

      <P>(E) If the candidate wishes to claim a larger compliance exemption for costs associated with computer services, the candidate shall establish allocation percentages for each computer function that is considered necessary, in whole or in part, to ensure compliance with 2 U.S.C. 431 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> and 26 U.S.C. 9001 <E T="03">et seq.</E> The allocation shall be <PRTPAGE P="197"/>based on a reasonable estimate of the costs associated with each computer function, such as the costs for data entry services performed by persons other than committee personnel and processing time. The candidate shall keep detailed records to support such calculations. The records shall indicate which computer functions are considered compliance-related and shall reflect which costs are associated with each computer function.</P>
      <P>(F) The Commission's Financial Control and Compliance Manual for General Election Candidates Receiving Public Funding contains some accepted alternative allocation methods for determining the amount of salaries and overhead expenditures that may be considered exempt compliance costs.</P>
      <P>(G) Reimbursement from the GELAC may be made to the separate account maintained for federal funds under 11 CFR 9005.2 for legal and accounting compliance services disbursements that are initially paid from the separate federal funds account. Such reimbursement must be made prior to any repayment determination by the Commission pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.2. Any amounts so reimbursed to the Federal funds account may not subsequently be transferred back to the GELAC.</P>
      <P>(iii) Amounts paid from the GELAC for the purposes permitted by paragraphs (a)(2)(i) (A) through (F) and (H) of this section shall not be subject to the expenditure limits of 2 U.S.C. 441a(b) and 11 CFR 110.8. (See also 11 CFR 100.8(b)(15).) When the proceeds of loans made in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i)(G) of this section are expended on qualified campaign expenses, such expenditures shall count against the candidate's expenditure limit.</P>
      <P>(iv) Contributions to or funds deposited in the GELAC may not be used to retire debts remaining from the presidential primaries, except that, if after payment of all expenses set out in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, there are excess campaign funds, such funds may be used for any purpose permitted under 2 U.S.C. 439a and 11 CFR part 113, including payment of primary election debts.</P>
      <P>(3) <E T="03">Deposit and disclosure.</E> (i) Amounts received pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be deposited and maintained in a GELAC account separate from the account described in 11 CFR 9005.2 and shall not be commingled with any money paid to the candidate by the Secretary pursuant to 11 CFR 9005.2.</P>
      <P>(ii) The receipts to and disbursements from the GELAC account shall be reported in a separate report in accordance with 11 CFR 9006.1(b)(2). All contributions made to the GELAC account shall be recorded in accordance with 11 CFR 102.9. Disbursements made from the GELAC account shall be documented in the same manner provided in 11 CFR 9003.5.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Contributions to defray qualified campaign expenses—major party candidates.</E> (1) A major party candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) may solicit contributions to defray qualified campaign expenses to the extent necessary to make up any deficiency in payments received from the Fund due to the application of 11 CFR 9005.2(b).</P>

Disbursements from this account shall be made only to defray qualified campaign expenses and to defray the cost of soliciting contributions to such account. All disbursements from this account shall be documented in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.5 and shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 9006.1.</P>
      <P>(3) A candidate may make transfers to this account from his or her GELAC, or from the candidate's primary election account in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
      <P>(4) The contributions received under this section shall be subject to the limitations and prohibitions of 11 CFR Parts 110, 114 and 115 and shall be aggregated with all contributions made by the same persons to the candidate's GELAC under paragraph (a) of this section for the purposes of such limitations.</P>

      <P>(5) Any costs incurred for soliciting contributions to this account shall not be considered expenditures to the extent that the aggregate of such costs does not exceed 20 percent of the expenditure limitation under 11 CFR 9003.2(a)(1). These costs shall, however, <PRTPAGE P="198"/>be reported as disbursements in accordance with 11 CFR Part 104 and 11 CFR 9006.1. For purposes of this section, a candidate may exclude from the expenditure limitation an amount equal to 10% of the payroll (including payroll taxes) and overhead expenditures of his or her national campaign headquarters and state offices as exempt fundraising costs. The candidate may claim a larger fundraising exemption by establishing allocation percentages for employees using the method described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.</P>

      <P>(6) Any costs incurred for legal and accounting services which are provided solely to ensure compliance with 2 U.S.C. 431 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and 26 U.S.C. 9001 <E T="03">et seq.</E> shall not count against the candidate's expenditure limitation.

      <P>(7) The Commission's Financial Control and Compliance Manual for General Election Candidates Receiving Public Funding contains some accepted alternative allocation methods for determining the amount of salaries and overhead expenditures that may be considered exempt compliance costs or exempt fundraising costs.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Contributions to defray qualified campaign expenses—minor and new party candidates.</E> (1) A minor or new party candidate may solicit contributions to defray qualified campaign expenses which exceed the amount received by such candidate from the Fund, subject to the limits of 11 CFR 9003.2(b).</P>
      <P>(2) The contributions received under this section shall be subject to the limitations and prohibitions of 11 CFR parts 110, 114 and 115.</P>

An authorized agent of the requesting person may submit the advisory opinion request, but the agent shall disclose the identity of his or her principal.</P>
      <P>(b) The written advisory opinion request shall set forth a specific transaction or activity that the requesting person plans to undertake or is presently undertaking and intends to undertake in the future. Requests presenting a general question of interpretation, or posing a hypothetical situation, or regarding the activities of third parties, do not qualify as advisory opinion requests.</P>
      <P>(c) Advisory opinion requests shall include a complete description of all facts relevant to the specific transaction or activity with respect to which the request is made.</P>
      <P>(d) The Office of General Counsel shall review all requests for advisory opinions submitted under 11 CFR 112.1. If the Office of General Counsel determines that a request for an advisory opinion is incomplete or otherwise not qualified under 11 CFR 112.1, it shall, within 10 calendar days of receipt of such request, notify the requesting person and specify the deficiencies in the request.</P>
      <P>(e) Advisory opinion requests should be sent to the Federal Election Commission, Office of General Counsel, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20463.</P>
      <P>(f) Upon receipt by the Commission, each request which qualifies as an advisory opinion request (AOR) under 11 CFR 112.1 shall be assigned an AOR number for reference purposes.</P>

Additional time for submission of written comments may be granted upon written request for an extension by the person who wishes to submit comments or may be granted by the Commission without an extension request.</P>
      <P>(c) Comments on advisory opinion requests should refer to the AOR number of the request, and statutory references should be to the United States Code citations, rather than to Public Law citations.</P>
      <P>(d) Written comments and requests for additional time to comment shall be sent to the Federal Election Commission, Office of General Counsel, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20463.</P>

      <P>(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person who relies upon an advisory opinion in accordance with 11 CFR 112.5(a) and who acts in good faith in accordance with that advisory opinion shall not, as a result of any such act, be subject to any sanction provided by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, or by chapters 95 or 96 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Reconsideration of advisory opinions.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) The Commission may reconsider an advisory opinion previously issued if the person to whom the opinion was issued submits a written request for reconsideration within 30 calendar days of receipt of the opinion and if, upon the motion of a Commissioner who voted with the majority that originally approved the opinion, the Commission adopts the motion to reconsider by the affirmative vote of 4 members.</P>

      <P>(c) In the event an advisory opinion is reconsidered pursuant to 11 CFR 112.6(b), the action taken in good faith reliance on that advisory opinion by the person to whom the opinion was issued shall not result in any sanction provided by the Act or chapters 95 or 96 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. 11 CFR 112.6(c) shall not be effective after the date when the person to whom the advisory opinion was issued has received actual notice of the Commission's decision to reconsider that advisory opinion.</P>

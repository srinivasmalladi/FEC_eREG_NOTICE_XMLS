        <P>The Federal Election Commission published a document in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of August 8, 2003, at 68 FR 47386, containing revised regulations at 11 CFR 104.5, 107.2, 110.2, 9001.1, 9003.1, 9003.3, 9003.5, 9004.4, 9008.3, 9008.7, 9008.8, 9008.10, 9008.12, 9008.50, 9008.51, 9008.52, 9008.53, 9031.1, 9032.9, 9033.1, 9033.11, 9034.4, 9035.1, 9036.1, 9036.2, and 9038.2, and new regulations at 11 CFR 9004.11, 9008.55, 9034.10, and 9034.11. The Commission is announcing the effective date for these regulations. Section 9009(c) of Title 26, United States Code, require that any rules or regulations prescribed by the Commission to carry out the provisions of the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act be transmitted to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate thirty legislative days prior to final promulgation. These rules were transmitted to Congress on July 31, 2003. Thirty legislative days expired in the Senate and the House of Representatives on November 4, 2003.</P>
        <REGTEXT PART="104" TITLE="11">
          <P>The Commission's document published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on August 8, 2003, contained three incorrect references and one incorrect amendatory instruction. First, the document as published included a reference to a provision that was not adopted by the Commission. That provision was originally located in 11 CFR 9008.55(d). Prior to adopting the final rules, the Commission deleted 11 CFR 9008.55(d) and redesignated paragraph (e) of 11 CFR 9008.55 as paragraph (d). While this change was reflected in the regulatory text of 11 CFR 9008.55 and in its Explanation and Justification, the deleted provision was cited as 11 CFR 9008.55(d) in one instance.<E T="03">See</E>69 FR 47403 (third column). Thus, this correction deletes the misleading reference to &#x201C;11 CFR 9008.55(d)&#x201D; in the third column on page 47403.</P>

          <P>Second, the document as published contained two incorrect references to the provision that was proposed to be 11 CFR 9008.55(e) but was redesignated in the final regulations to be 11 CFR 9008.55(d). This change was reflected in the regulatory text of 11 CFR 9008.55, but the Explanation and Justification for 11 CFR 9008.55 cited the redesignated provision as 11 CFR 9008.55(e) in two instances.<E T="03">See</E>69 FR 47404 (second and third columns). Thus, this correction changes the references in the second and third columns on page 47404 from &#x201C;11 CFR 9008.55(e)&#x201D; to &#x201C;11 CFR 9008.55(d).&#x201D;</P>
          <P>Third, the document as published contained one incorrect amendatory instruction. Amendatory instruction 29 in the third column on page 47418, incorrectly identified 11 CFR 9031.1 as 11 CFR 9003.1. Thus, this correction changes this reference in amendatory instruction 29 in the third column on page 47418 from &#x201C;11 CFR 9003.1&#x201D; to &#x201C;11 CFR 9031.1.&#x201D;</P>

          <P>29. Section 9031.1 is amended by removing the number &#x201C;116&#x201D; and adding in its place the number &#x201C;400&#x201D; in both instances in which &#x201C;116&#x201D; appears.</P>

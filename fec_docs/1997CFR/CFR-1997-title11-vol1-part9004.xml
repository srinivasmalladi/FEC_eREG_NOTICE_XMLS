      <SUBJECT>Major parties.</SUBJECT>
      <P>The eligible candidates of each major party in a Presidential election shall be entitled to equal payments under 11 CFR part 9005 in an amount which, in the aggregate, shall not exceed $20,000,000 as adjusted by the Consumer Price Index in the manner described in 11 CFR 110.9(c).</P>

      <SUBJECT>Pre-election payments for minor and new party candidates.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">Candidate of a minor party in the preceding election.</E> An eligible candidate of a minor party is entitled to pre-election payments:</P>
      <P>(1) If he or she received at least 5% of the total popular vote as the candidate of a minor party in the preceding election whether or not he or she is the same minor party's candidate in this election.</P>
      <P>(2) In an amount which is equal, in the aggregate, to a proportionate share of the amount to which major party candidates are entitled under 11 CFR 9004.1.</P>
      <FP>The aggregate amount received by a minor party candidate shall bear the same ratio to the amount received by the major party candidates as the number of popular votes received by the minor party Presidential candidate in the preceding Presidential election bears to the average number of popular votes received by all major party candidates in that election.</FP>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Candidate of a minor party in the current election.</E> The eligible candidate of a minor party whose candidate for the office of President in the preceding election received at least 5% but less than 25% of the total popular vote is eligible to receive pre-election payments. The amount which a minor party candidate is entitled to receive under this section shall be computed pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.2(a) based on the number of popular votes received by the minor party's candidate in the preceding Presidential election; however, the amount to which the minor party candidate is entitled under this section shall be reduced by the amount to which the minor party's Presidential candidate in this election is entitled under 11 CFR 9004.2(a), if any.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">New party candidate.</E> A candidate of a new party who was a candidate for the office of President in at least 10 States in the preceding election may be eligible to receive pre-election payments if he or she received at least 5% but less than 25% of the total popular vote in the preceding election. The amount which a new party candidate is entitled to receive under this section shall be computed pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.2(a) based on the number of popular votes received by the new party candidate in the preceding election. If a new party candidate is entitled to payments under this section, the amount of the entitlement shall be reduced by the amount to which the candidate is entitled under 11 CFR 9004.2(a), if any.</P>

      <SECTNO>§ 9004.3</SECTNO>
      <SUBJECT>Post-election payments.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">Minor and new party candidates.</E> Eligible candidates of a minor party or of a new party who, as candidates, receive 5 percent or more of the total number of popular votes cast for the office of President in the election shall be entitled to payments under 11 CFR part 9005 equal, in the aggregate, to a proportionate share of the amount allowed for major party candidates under 11 CFR 9004.1. The amount to which a minor or new party candidate is entitled shall bear the same ratio to the amount received by the major party candidates as the number of popular votes received by the minor or new party candidate in the Presidential election bears to the average number of popular votes received by the major party candidates for President in that election.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of entitlement.</E> The aggregate payments to which an eligible candidate shall be entitled shall not exceed an amount equal to the lower of:</P>
      <P>(1) The amount of qualified campaign expenses incurred by such eligible candidate and his or her authorized committee(s), reduced by the amount of contributions which are received to defray qualified campaign expenses by such eligible candidate and such committee(s); or</P>

      <P>(2) The aggregate payments to which the eligible candidates of a major party are entitled under 11 CFR 9004.1, reduced by the amount of contributions received by such eligible candidates <PRTPAGE P="203"/>and their authorized committees to defray qualified campaign expenses in the case of a deficiency in the Fund.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Amount of entitlement limited by pre-election payment.</E> If an eligible candidate is entitled to payment under 11 CFR 9004.2, the amount allowable to that candidate under this section shall also be limited to the amount, if any, by which the entitlement under 11 CFR 9004.3(a) exceeds the amount of the entitlement under 11 CFR 9004.2.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Use of payments.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">Qualified campaign expenses</E>. An eligible candidate shall use payments received under 11 CFR part 9005 only for the following purposes:</P>
      <P>(1) To defray qualified campaign expenses;</P>
      <P>(2) To repay loans that meet the requirements of 11 CFR 100.7 (a)(1) or (b)(11) or to otherwise restore funds (other than contributions received pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.3 (b) or (c) and expended to defray qualified campaign expenses) used to defray qualified campaign expenses;</P>
      <P>(3) To restore funds expended in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.4 for qualified campaign expenses incurred by the candidate prior to the beginning of the expenditure report period.</P>
      <P>(4) <E T="03">Winding down costs.</E> The following costs shall be considered qualified campaign expenses:</P>
      <P>(i) Costs associated with the termination of the candidate's general election campaign such as complying with the post-election requirements of the Act and other necessary administrative costs associated with winding down the campaign, including office space rental, staff salaries, and office supplies; or</P>
      <P>(ii) Costs incurred by the candidate prior to the end of the expenditure report period for which written arrangement or commitment was made on or before the close of the expenditure report period.</P>

      <P>(iii) 100% of salary, overhead and computer expenses incurred after the end of the expenditure report period may be paid from a legal and accounting compliance fund established pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.3, and will be presumed to be solely to ensure compliance with 2 U.S.C. 431 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and 26 U.S.C. 9001 <E T="03">et seq.</E>
      </P>

      <P>(i) Gifts for committee employees, consultants and volunteers in recognition for campaign-related activities or services do not exceed $150 total per individual and the total of all gifts does not exceed $20,000; and</P>

      <P>(A) Are provided for pursuant to a written contract made prior to the date of the election; and</P>

      <P>(b) <E T="03">Non-qualified campaign expenses</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The following are examples of disbursements that are not qualified campaign expenses.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Excessive expenditures.</E> An expenditure which is in excess of any of the limitations under 11 CFR 9003.2 shall not be considered a qualified campaign expense. The Commission will calculate the amount of expenditures attributable to these limitations using the full amounts originally charged for goods and services rendered to the committee and not the amounts for which such obligations were later settled and paid, unless the committee can demonstrate that the lower amount paid reflects a reasonable settlement of a bona fide dispute with the creditor.</P>
      <P>(3) <E T="03">Expenditures incurred after the close of the expenditure report period.</E> Any expenditures incurred after the close of the expenditure report period, as defined in 11 CFR 9002.12, are not qualified campaign expenses except to the extent permitted under 11 CFR 9004.4(a)(4).</P>
      <P>(4) <E T="03">Civil or criminal penalties.</E> Civil or criminal penalties paid pursuant to the Federal Election Campaign Act are not qualified campaign expenses and cannot be defrayed from payments received under 11 CFR part 9005. Penalties may be paid from contributions in the candidate's legal and accounting compliance fund, in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.3(a)(2)(i)(C). Additional amounts may be received and expended to pay such penalties, if necessary. <PRTPAGE P="204"/>These funds shall not be considered contributions or expenditures but all amounts so received shall be subject to the prohibitions of the Act. Amounts received and expended under this section shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR part 104.</P>
      <P>(5) <E T="03">Solicitation expenses.</E> Any expenses incurred by a major party candidate to solicit contributions to a legal and accounting compliance fund established pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.3(a) are not qualified campaign expenses and cannot be defrayed from payments received under 11 CFR part 9005.</P>
      <P>(6) <E T="03">Payments to candidate.</E> Payments made to the candidate by his or her committee, other than to reimburse funds advanced by the candidate for qualified campaign expenses, are not qualified campaign expenses.</P>
      <P>(7) <E T="03">Payments to other authorized committees.</E> Payments, including transfers, contributions and loans, to other committees authorized by the same candidate for a different election are not qualified campaign expenses.</P>
      <P>(8) <E T="03">Lost or Misplaced Items</E>. The cost of lost or misplaced items may be considered a nonqualified campaign expense. Factors considered by the commission in making this determination shall include, but not be limited to, whether the committee demonstrates that it made conscientious efforts to safeguard the missing equipment; whether the committee sought or obtained insurance; the type of equipment involved; and the number and value of items that were lost.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Expenditures for transportation and services made available to media personnel; reimbursements.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">General</E>. (1) Expenditures by an authorized committee for transportation, ground services or facilities (including air travel, ground transportation, housing, meals, telephone service, and typewriters) made available to media personnel, Secret Service personnel or national security staff will be considered qualified campaign expenses, and, except for costs relating to Secret Service personnel or national security staff, will be subject to the overall expenditure limitations of 11 CFR 9003.2 (a)(1) and (b)(1).</P>
      <P>(2) Subject to the limitation in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, committees may seek reimbursement for these expenses, and may deduct reimbursements received from media representatives from the amount of expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitations of 11 CFR 9003.2 (a)(1) and (b)(1). Expenses for which the committee receives no reimbursement will be considered qualified campaign expenses, and, with the exception of those expenses relating to Secret Service personnel and national security staff, will be subject to the overall expenditure limitation.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Reimbursement limits.</E> (1) The amount of reimbursement sought from a media representative under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not exceed 110% of the media representative's pro rata share (or a reasonable estimate of the media representative's pro rata share) of the actual cost of the transportation and services made available. Any reimbursement received in excess of this amount shall be disposed of in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>

      <P>(2) For the purpose of this section, a media representative's pro rata share shall be calculated by dividing the total actual cost of the transportation and services provided by the total number of individuals to whom such transportation and services are made available. For purposes of this calculation, <PRTPAGE P="205"/>the total number of individuals shall include committee staff, media personnel, Secret Service personnel, national security staff and any other individuals to whom such transportation and services are made available, except that, when seeking reimbursement for transportation costs paid by the committee under 11 CFR 9004.7(b)(5)(i)(C), the total number of individuals shall not include national security staff.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Deducation of reimbursements from expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation.</E> (1) The committee may deduct from the amount of expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation:</P>
      <P>(i) The amount of reimbursements received from media representatives in payment for the transportation and services described in paragraph (a) of this section, up to the actual cost of the transportation and services provided to media representatives; and</P>
      <P>(ii) An additional amount of the reimbursements received from media representatives, representing the administrative costs incurred by the committee in providing these services to the media representative and seeking reimbursement for them, equal to:</P>
      <P>(A) Three percent of the actual cost of transportation and services provided to the media representatives under this section; or</P>
      <P>(B) An amount in excess of 3% representing the administrative costs actually incurred by the committee in providing services to the media representatives, provided that the committee is able to document the total amount of administrative costs actually incurred.</P>
      <P>(2) For the purpose of this paragraph, “administrative costs” includes all costs incurred by the committee in making travel arrangements and seeking reimbursement, whether these services are performed by committee staff or by independent contractors.</P>
      <P>(d) <E T="03">Disposal of excess reimbursements.</E> If the committee receives reimbursements in excess of the amount deductible under paragraph (c) of this section, it shall dispose of the excess amount in the following manner:</P>
      <P>(1) Any reimbursement received in excess of 110% of the actual pro rata cost of the transportation and services made available to a media representative shall be returned to the media representative.</P>
      <P>(2) Any amount in excess of the amount deductible under paragraph (c) of this section that is not required to be returned to the media representative under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be paid to the Treasury.</P>
      <P>(e) <E T="03">Reporting.</E> The total amount paid by an authorized committee for the services and facilities described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, plus the administrative costs incurred by the committee in providing these services and facilities and seeking reimbursement for them, shall be reported as an expenditure in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(b)(2)(i). Any reimbursement received by such committee under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(a)(3)(ix).</P>

      <SUBJECT>Allocation of travel expenditures.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of 11 CFR 106.3, expenditures for travel relating to a Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate's campaign by any individual, including a candidate, shall, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, be qualified campaign expenses and be reported by the candidate's authorized committee(s) as expenditures.</P>
      <P>(b)(1) For a trip which is entirely campaign-related, the total cost of the trip shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure.</P>

      <P>(2) For a trip which includes campaign-related and non-campaign related stops, that portion of the cost of the trip allocable to campaign activity shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure. Such portion shall be determined by calculating what the trip would have cost from the point of origin of the trip to the first campaign-related stop and from the stop through each subsequent campaign-related stop to the point of origin. If any campaign activity, other than incidental contacts, is conducted at a stop, that stop shall be considered campaign-related. Campaign activity <PRTPAGE P="206"/>includes soliciting, making, or accepting contributions, and expressly advocating the election or defeat of the candidate. Other factors, including the setting, timing and statements or expressions of the purpose of an event, and the substance of the remarks or speech made, will also be considered in determining whether a stop is campaign-related.</P>
      <P>(3) For each trip, an itinerary shall be prepared and such itinerary shall be made available by the committee for Commission inspection. The itinerary shall show the time of arrival and departure and the type of events held.</P>
      <P>(4) For trips by government conveyance or by charter, a list of all passengers on such trip, along with a designation of which passengers are and which are not campaign-related, shall be made available for Commission inspection. When required to be created, a copy of the government's or charter company's official manifest shall also be maintained and made available by the committee.</P>
      <P>(5)(i) If any individual, including a candidate, uses a government airplane for campaign-related travel, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to:</P>
      <P>(A) The lowest unrestricted and non-discounted first class commercial air fare available for the time traveled, in the case of travel to a city served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline service; or</P>
      <P>(B) The lowest unrestricted and non-discounted coach commercial air fare available for the time traveled, in the case of travel to a city served by regularly scheduled coach airline service, but not regularly scheduled first class airline service; or</P>
      <P>(C) In the case of travel to a city not served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline service, the commercial charter rate for an airplane sufficient in size to accommodate the campaign-related travelers, including the candidate, plus the news media and the Secret Service.</P>
      <P>(ii) If a government airplane is flown to a campaign-related stop where it will pick up passengers, or from a campaign-related stop where it left off passengers, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the greater of the amount billed or the amount required under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section for one passenger.</P>
      <P>(iii) If any individual, including a candidate, uses a government conveyance, other than an airplane, for campaign-related travel, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the commercial rental rate for a conveyance sufficient in size to accommodate the campaign-related travelers, including the candidate, plus the news media and the Secret Service.</P>
      <P>(iv) If any individual, including a candidate, uses accommodations, including lodging and meeting rooms, during campaign-related travel, and the accommodations are paid for by a government entity, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the usual and normal charge for the accommodations, and shall maintain documentation supporting the amount paid.</P>
      <P>(v) For travel by airplane, the committee shall maintain documentation of the lowest unrestricted nondiscounted air fare available for the time traveled, including the airline, flight number and travel service providing that fare or the charter rate, as appropriate. For travel by other conveyances, the committee shall maintain documentation of the commercial rental rate for a conveyance of sufficient size, including the provider of the conveyance and the size, model and make of the conveyance.</P>
      <P>(6) Travel expenses of a candidate's spouse and family when accompanying the candidate on campaign-related travel may be treated as qualified campaign expenses and reportable expenditures. If the spouse or family members conduct campaign-related activities, their travel expenses shall be qualified campaign expenses and reportable expenditures.</P>

      <P>(7) If any individual, including a candidate, incurs expenses for campaign-related travel, other than by use of government conveyance or accommodations, an amount equal to that <PRTPAGE P="207"/>portion of the actual cost of the conveyance or accommodations which is allocable to all passengers, including the candidate, who are traveling for campaign purposes shall be a qualified campaign expense and shall be reported by the committee as an expenditure.</P>
      <P>(i) If the trip is by charter, the actual cost for each passenger shall be determined by dividing the total operating cost for the charter by the total number of passengers transported. The amount which is a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9004.7(b)(2) on the basis of the actual cost per passenger multiplied by the number of passengers traveling for campaign purposes.</P>
      <P>(ii) If the trip is by non-charter commercial transportation, the actual cost shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9004.7(b)(2) on the basis of the commercial fare. Such actual cost shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure.</P>
      <P>(8) Travel on corporate airplanes and other corporate conveyances is governed by 11 CFR 114.9(e).</P>

The statement shall contain the information required under 11 CFR 9004.9(a) (1) and (2), except that the amount of outstanding obligations under 11 CFR 9004.9(a)(1)(i) and the amount of cash on hand, assets and receivables under 11 CFR 9004.9(a)(2) shall be complete as of the day on which the individual ceased to be a candidate.</P>
      <P>(d)(1) <E T="03">Capital assets.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “capital asset” means any property used in the operation of the campaign whose purchase price exceeded $2000 when acquired by the committee. Property that must be valued as capital assets under this section includes, but is not limited to, office equipment, furniture, vehicles and fixtures acquired for use in the operation of the candidate's campaign, but does not include property defined as “other assets” under 11 CFR 9004.9(d)(2). A list of all capital assets shall be maintained by the committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.5(d)(1). The fair market value of capital assets may be considered to be the total original cost of such items when acquired less 40%, to account for depreciation, except that items acquired after the date of ineligibility must be valued at their fair market value on the date acquired.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Other assets.</E> The term <E T="03">other assets</E> means any property acquired by the committee for use in raising funds or as collateral for campaign loans. “Other assets” must be included on the candidate's statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses if the aggregate value of such assets exceeds $5000. The value of “other assets” shall be determined by the fair market value of each item on the last day of the expenditure report period or the day on which the individual ceased to be a candidate, whichever is earlier, unless the item is acquired after these dates, in which case the item shall be valued on the date it is acquired. A list of other assets shall be maintained by the committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.5(d)(2).</P>
      <P>(e) <E T="03">Collectibility of accounts receivable.</E> If the committee determines that an account receivable of $500 or more, including any credit, refund, return or rebate, is not collectible in whole or in part, the committee shall demonstrate through documentation that the determination was commercially reasonable. The documentation shall include records showing the original amount of the account receivable, copies of correspondence and memoranda of communications with the debtor showing attempts to collect the amount due, and an explanation of how the lesser amount or full write-off was determined.</P>
      <P>(f) <E T="03">Review of candidate statement</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The Commission will review the statement filed by each candidate under this section. The Commission may request further information with respect to statements filed pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.9(b) during the audit of that candidate's authorized committee(s) under 11 CFR part 9007.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Candidate eligible for post-election funding.</E> (i) If, in reviewing the preliminary statement of a candidate eligible to receive post-election funding, the Commission receives information indicating that substantial assets of that candidate's authorized committee(s) have been undervalued or not included in the statement or that the amount of <PRTPAGE P="209"/>outstanding qualified campaign expenses has been otherwise overstated in relation to committee assets, the Commission may decide to temporarily postpone its certification of funds to that candidate pending a final determination of whether the candidate is entitled to all or a portion of the funds for which he or she is eligible based on the percentage of votes the candidate received in the general election.</P>
      <P>(ii) <E T="03">Initial determination.</E> In making a determination under 11 CFR 9004.9(f)(2)(i), the Commission will notify the candidate within 10 business days after its receipt of the statement of its initial determination that the candidate is not entitled to receive the full amount for which the candidate may be eligible. The notice will give the legal and factual reasons for the initial determination and advise the candidate of the evidence on which the Commission's initial determination is based. The candidate will be given the opportunity to revise the statement or to submit, within 10 business days, written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that the candidate has net outstanding qualified campaign expenses that entitle the candidate to post-election funds. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires.</P>
      <P>(iii) <E T="03">Final determination.</E> The Commission will consider any written legal or factual materials submitted by the candidate before making its final determination. A final determination that the candidate is entitled to receive only a portion or no post-election funding will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons for the Commission's action. This statement will explain the legal and factual reasons underlying the Commission's determination and will summarize the results of any investigation on which the determination is based.</P>
      <P>(iv) If the candidate demonstrates that the amount of outstanding qualified campaign expenses still exceeds committee assets, the Commission will certify the payment of post-election funds to which the candidate is entitled.</P>
      <P>(v) <E T="03">Petitions for rehearing.</E> The candidate may file a petition for rehearing of a final determination under this section in accordance with 11 CFR 9007.5(a).</P>

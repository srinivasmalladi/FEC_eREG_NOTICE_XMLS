      <SUBJECT>Candidate entitlements.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) A candidate who has been notified by the Commission under 11 CFR 9036.1 that he or she has successfully satisfied eligibility and certification requirements is entitled to receive payments under 26 U.S.C. 9037 and 11 CFR part 9037 in an amount equal to the amount of each matchable campaign contribution received by the candidate, except that a candidate who has become ineligible under 11 CFR 9033.5 may not receive further matching payments regardless of the date of deposit of the underlying contributions if he or she has no net outstanding campaign obligations as defined in 11 CFR 9034.5. See also 26 CFR parts 701 and 702 regarding payments by the Department of the Treasury.</P>
      <P>(b) If on the date of ineligibility a candidate has net outstanding campaign obligations as defined under 11 CFR 9034.5, that candidate may continue to receive matching payments for matchable contributions received and deposited on or before December 31 of the Presidential election year provided that on the date of payment there are remaining net outstanding campaign obligations, i.e., the sum of the contributions received on or after the date of ineligibility plus matching funds received on or after the date of ineligibility is less than the candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations. This entitlement will be equal to the lesser of:</P>
      <P>(1) The amount of contributions submitted for matching; or</P>
      <P>(2) The remaining net outstanding campaign obligations.</P>
      <P>(c) A candidate whose eligibility has been reestablished under 11 CFR 9033.8 or who after suspension of payments has met the conditions set forth at 11 CFR 9033.9(d) is entitled to receive payments for matchable contributions for which payments were not received during the ineligibility or suspension period.</P>
      <P>(d) The total amount of payments to a candidate under this section shall not exceed 50% of the total expenditure limitation applicable under 11 CFR part 9035.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Matchable contributions.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) Contributions meeting the following requirements will be considered matchable campaign contributions.</P>
      <P>(1) The contribution shall be a gift of money made: By an individual; by a written instrument and for the purpose of influencing the result of a primary election.</P>

      <P>(2) Only a maximum of $250 of the aggregate amount contributed by an individual may be matched.<PRTPAGE P="249"/>
      </P>
      <P>(3) Before a contribution may be submitted for matching, it must actually be received by the candidate or any of the candidate's authorized committees and deposited in a designated campaign depository maintained by the candidate's authorized committee.</P>
      <P>(4) The written instrument used in making the contribution must be dated, physically received and deposited by the candidate or authorized committee on or after January l of the year immediately preceding the calendar year of the Presidential election, but no later than December 31 following the matching payment period as defined under 11 CFR 9032.6. Donations received by an individual who is testing the waters pursuant to 11 CFR 100.7(b)(1) and 100.8(b)(1) may be matched when the individual becomes a candidate if such donations meet the requirements of this section.</P>
      <P>(b) For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">written instrument</E> means a check written on a personal, escrow or trust account representing or containing the contributor's personal funds; a money order; or any similar negotiable instrument.</P>
      <P>(c) The written instrument shall be: Payable on demand; and to the order of, or specifically endorsed without qualification to, the Presidential candidate, or his or her authorized committee. The written instrument shall contain: The full name and signature of the contributor(s); the amount and date of the contribution; and the mailing address of the contributor(s).</P>
      <P>(1) In cases of a check drawn on a joint checking account, the contributor is considered to be the owner whose signature appears on the check.</P>
      <P>(i) To be attributed equally to other joint tenants of the account, the check or other accompanying written document shall contain the signature(s) of the joint tenant(s). If a contribution on a joint account is to be attributed other than equally to the joint tenants, the check or other written documentation shall also indicate the amount to be attributed to each joint tenant.</P>
      <P>(ii) In the case of a check for a contribution attributed to more than one person, where it is not apparent from the face of the check that each contributor is a joint tenant of the account, a written statement shall accompany the check stating that the contribution was made from each individual's personal funds in the amount so attributed and shall be signed by each contributor.</P>
      <P>(iii) In the case of a contribution reattributed to a joint tenant of the account, the reattribution shall comply with the requirements of 11 CFR 110.1(k) and the documentation described in 11 CFR 110.1 (1), (3), (5) and (6) shall accompany the reattributed contribution.</P>
      <P>(2) Contributions in the form of checks drawn on an escrow or trust account are matchable contributions, provided that:</P>
      <P>(i) The contributor has equitable ownership of the account; and</P>
      <P>(ii) The check is accompanied by a statement, signed by each contributor to whom all or a portion of the contribution is being attributed, together with the check number, amount and date of contribution. This statement shall specify that the contributor has equitable ownership of the account and the account represents the personal funds of the contributor.</P>
      <P>(3) Contributions in the form of checks written on partnership accounts or accounts of unincorporated associations or businesses are matchable contributions, so long as:</P>
      <P>(i) The check is accompanied by a statement, signed by each contributor to whom all or a portion of the contribution is being attributed, together with the check number, amount and date of contribution. This statement shall specify that the contribution is made with the contributor's personal funds and that the account on which the contribution is drawn is not maintained or controlled by an incorporated entity; and</P>
      <P>(ii) The aggregate amount of the contributions drawn on a partnership or unincorporated association or business does not exceed $1,000 to any one Presidential candidate seeking nomination.</P>
      <P>(4) Contributions in the form of money orders, cashier's checks, or other similar negotiable instruments are matchable contributions, provided that:</P>

      <P>(i) At the time it is initially submitted for matching, such instrument is <PRTPAGE P="250"/>signed by each contributor and is accompanied by a statement which specifies that the contribution was made in the form of a money order, cashier's check, traveler's check, or other similar negotiable instrument, with the contributor's personal funds;</P>
      <P>(ii) Such statement identifies the date and amount of the contribution made by money order, cashier's check, traveler's check, or other similar negotiable instrument, the check or serial number, and the name of the issuer of the negotiable instrument; and</P>
      <P>(iii) Such statement is signed by each contributor.</P>
      <P>(5) Contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for the admission to any activity that primarily confers private benefits in the form of entertainment to the contributor (i.e., concerts, motion pictures) are matchable. The promotional material and tickets for the event shall clearly indicate that the ticket purchase price represents a contribution to the Presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>(6) Contributions in the form of a purchase price paid for admission to an activity that is essentially political are matchable. An “essentially political” activity is one the principal purpose of which is political speech or discussion, such as the traditional political dinner or reception.</P>
      <P>(7) Contributions received from a joint fundraising activity conducted in accordance with 11 CFR 9034.8 are matchable, provided that such contributions are accompanied by a copy of the joint fundraising agreement when they are submitted for matching.</P>

      <SECTNO>§ 9034.3</SECTNO>
      <SUBJECT>Non-matchable contributions.</SUBJECT>
      <P>A contribution to a candidate other than one which meets the requirements of 11 CFR 9034.2 is not matchable. Contributions which are not matchable include, for example:</P>
      <P>(a) In-kind contributions of real or personal property;</P>
      <P>(b) A subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money, or anything of value;</P>
      <P>(c) A contract, promise, or agreement, whether or not legally enforceable, such as a pledge card or credit card transaction, to make a contribution for any such purposes (but a gift of money by written instrument is not rendered unmatchable solely because the contribution was preceded by a promise or pledge);</P>
      <P>(d) Funds from a corporation, labor organization, government contractor, political committee as defined in 11 CFR 100.5 or any group of persons other than those under 11 CFR 9034.2(c)(3);</P>
      <P>(e) Contributions which are made or accepted in violation of 2 U.S.C. 441a, 441b, 441c, 441e, 441f, or 441g;</P>
      <P>(f) Contributions in the form of a check drawn on the account of a committee, corporation, union or government contractor even though the funds represent personal funds earmarked by a contributing individual to a Presidential candidate;</P>
      <P>(g) Contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for an item with significant intrinsic and enduring value, such as a watch;</P>
      <P>(h) Contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for or other otherwise induced by a chance to participate in a raffle, lottery, or a similar drawing for valuable prizes;</P>
      <P>(i) Contributions which are made by persons without the necessary donative intent to make a gift or made for any purpose other than to influence the result of a primary election;</P>
      <P>(j) Contributions of currency of the United States or currency of any foreign country; and</P>
      <P>(k) Contributions redesignated for a different election or redesignated for a legal and accounting compliance fund pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.3.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Use of contributions and matching payments.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">Qualified campaign expenses—</E>(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, all contributions received by an individual from the date he or she becomes a candidate and all matching payments received by the candidate shall be used only to defray qualified campaign expenses or to repay loans or otherwise restore funds (other than contributions which were received and expended to defray qualified campaign expenses), which were used to defray qualified campaign expenses.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Testing the waters.</E> Even though incurred prior to the date an individual becomes a candidate, payments made <PRTPAGE P="251"/>in accordance with the 11 CFR 100.8(b)(1) for the purpose of determining whether an individual should become a candidate shall be considered qualified campaign expenses if the individual subsequently becomes a candidate and shall count against that candidate's limits under 2 U.S.C. 441a(b).</P>
      <P>(3) <E T="03">Winding down costs and continuing to campaign.</E> (i) Costs associated with the termination of political activity, such as the costs of complying with the post election requirements of the Act and other necessary administrative costs associated with winding down the campaign, including office space rental, staff salaries, and office supplies, shall be considered qualified campaign expenses. A candidate may receive and use matching funds for these purposes either after he or she has notified the Commission in writing of his or her withdrawal from the campaign for nomination or after the date of the party's nominating convention, if he or she has not withdrawn before the convention.</P>
      <P>(ii) If the candidate continues to campaign after becoming ineligible due to the operation of 11 CFR 9033.5(b), the candidate may only receive matching funds based on net outstanding campaign obligations as of the candidate's date of ineligibility. The statement of net outstanding campaign obligations shall only include costs incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility for goods and services to be received before the date of ineligibility and for which written arrangement or commitment was made on or before the candidate's date of ineligibility, and shall not include winding down costs until the date on which the candidate qualifies to receive winding down costs under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
      <FP>Contributions received after the candidate's date of ineligibility may be used to continue to campaign, and may be submitted for matching fund payments. The candidate shall be entitled to receive the same proportion of matching funds to defray net outstanding campaign obligations as the candidate received before his or her date of ineligibility. Payments from the matching payment account that are received after the candidate's date of ineligibility may be used to defray the candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations, but shall not be used to defray any costs associated with continuing to campaign unless the candidate reestablishes eligibility under 11 CFR 9033.8.</FP>
      <P>(iii) For purposes of the expenditure limitations set forth in 11 CFR 9035.1, 100% of salary, overhead and computer expenses incurred after a candidate's date of ineligibility may be treated as exempt legal and accounting compliance expenses beginning with the first full reporting period after the candidate's date of ineligibility. For candidates who continue to campaign or re-establish eligibility, this paragraph shall not apply to expenses incurred during the period between the date of ineligibility and the date on which the candidate either re-establishes eligibility or ceases to continue to campaign.</P>
      <P>(4) <E T="03">Taxes.</E> Federal income taxes paid by the committee on non-exempt function income, such as interest, dividends and sale of property, shall be considered qualified campaign expenses. These expenses shall not, however, count against the state or overall expenditure limits of 11 CFR 9035.1(a).</P>
      <P>(5) <E T="03">Gifts and monetary bonuses.</E> Gifts and monetary bonuses shall be considered qualified campaign expenses, provided that:</P>
      <P>(i) Gifts for committee employees, consultants and volunteers in recognition for campaign-related activities or services do not exceed $150 total per individual and the total of all gifts does not exceed $20,000; and</P>
      <P>(ii) All monetary bonuses for committee employees and consultants in recognition for campaign-related activities or services:</P>
      <P>(A) Are provided for pursuant to a written contract made prior to the date of ineligibility; and</P>
      <P>(B) Are paid no later than thirty days after the date of ineligibility.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Non-qualified campaign expenses</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The following are examples of disbursements that are not qualified campaign expenses.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Excessive expenditures.</E> An expenditure which is in excess of any of the limitations under 11 CFR part 9035 <PRTPAGE P="252"/>shall not be considered a qualified campaign expense. The Commission will calculate the amount of expenditures attributable to the limitations in accordance with 11 CFR 9035.1(a)(2).</P>
      <P>(3) <E T="03">General election and post-ineligibility expenditures.</E> Any expenses incurred after a candidate's date of ineligibility, as determined under 11 CFR 9033.5, are not qualified campaign expenses except to the extent permitted under 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3). In addition, any expenses incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility for goods and services to be received after the candidate's date of ineligibility, or for property, services, or facilities used to benefit the candidate's general election campaign, are not qualified campaign expenses.</P>
      <P>(4) <E T="03">Civil or criminal penalties.</E> Civil or criminal penalties paid pursuant to the Federal Election Campaign Act are not qualified campaign expenses and cannot be defrayed from contributions or matching payments. Any amounts received or expended to pay such penalties shall not be considered contributions or expenditures but all amounts so received shall be subject to the prohibitions of the Act. Amounts received and expended under this section shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR part 104.</P>
      <P>(5) <E T="03">Payments to candidate.</E> Payments made to the candidate by his or her committee, other than to reimburse funds advanced by the candidate for qualified campaign expenses, are not qualified campaign expenses.</P>
      <P>(6) <E T="03">Payments to other authorized committees.</E> Payments, including transfers and loans, to other committees authorized by the same candidate for a different election are not qualified campaign expenses.</P>
      <P>(7) <E T="03">Allocable expenses.</E> Payments for expenses subject to state allocation under 11 CFR 106.2 are not qualified campaign expenses if the records retained are not sufficient to permit allocation to any state, such as the failure to keep records of the date on which the expense is incurred.</P>
      <P>(8) <E T="03">Lost or misplaced items.</E> The cost of lost or misplaced items may be considered a nonqualified campaign expense. Factors considered by the Commission in making this determination shall include, but not be limited to, whether the committee demonstrates that it made conscientious efforts to safeguard the missing equipment; whether the committee sought or obtained insurance; the type of equipment involved; and the number and value of items that were lost.</P>
      <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
      <P>(d) <E T="03">Transfers to other campaigns</E>—(1) <E T="03">Other Federal offices.</E> If a candidate has received matching funds and is simultaneously seeking nomination or election to another Federal office, no transfer of funds between his or her principal campaign committees or authorized committees may be made. See 2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(5)(C) and 11 CFR 110.3(c)(5) and 110.8(d). A candidate will be considered to be simultaneously seeking nomination or election to another Federal office if he or she is seeking nomination or election to such Federal office under 11 CFR 110.3(c)(5).</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">General election.</E> If a candidate has received matching funds, all transfers from the candidate's primary election account to a legal and accounting compliance fund established for the general election must be made in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.3(a)(1).</P>
      <P>(e) <E T="03">Attribution of expenditures between the primary and the general election limits.</E> The following rules apply to candidates who receive public funding in both the primary and the general election.</P>
      <P>(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Any expenditure for goods or services that are used exclusively for the primary election campaign shall be attributed to the limits set forth at 11 CFR 9035.1. Any expenditure for goods or services that are used exclusively for the general election campaign shall be attributed to the limits set forth at 11 CFR 110.8(a)(2), as adjusted under 11 CFR 110.9(c).</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Polling expenses.</E> Polling expenses shall be attributed according to when the results of the poll are received. If the results are received on or before the date of the candidate's nomination, the expenses shall be considered primary election expenses. If results are received from a single poll both before and after the date of the candidate's nomination, the costs shall be allocated between the primary and the general election limits based on the <PRTPAGE P="253"/>percentage of results received during each period.</P>
      <P>(3) <E T="03">State or national campaign offices.</E> Overhead expenditures and payroll costs incurred in connection with state or national campaign offices, shall be attributed according to when the usage occurs or the work is performed. For purposes of this section, overhead expenditures shall have the same meaning as set forth in 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(iii)(D). Expenses for usage of offices or work performed on or before the date of the candidate's nomination shall be attributed to the primary election, except for periods when the office is used only by persons working exclusively on general election campaign preparations.</P>
      <P>(4) <E T="03">Campaign materials.</E> Expenditures for campaign materials, including bumper stickers, campaign brochures, buttons, pens and similar items, that are purchased by the primary election campaign committee and later transferred to and used by the general election committee shall be attributed to the general election limits. Materials transferred to but not used by the general election committee shall be attributed to the primary election limits.</P>
      <P>(5) <E T="03">Media production costs.</E> For media communications that are broadcast or published both before and after the date of the candidate's nomination, 50% of the media production costs shall be attributed to the primary election limits, and 50% to the general election limits. Distribution costs, including such costs as air time and advertising space in newspapers, shall be paid for 100% by the primary or general election campaign depending on when the communication is broadcast or distributed.</P>
      <P>(6) <E T="03">Campaign Communications.</E> (i) <E T="03">Solicitations.</E> The costs of a solicitation shall be attributed to the primary election or to the GELAC, depending on the purpose of the solicitation. If a candidate solicits funds for both the primary election and for the GELAC in a single communication, 50% of the cost of the solicitation shall be attributed to the primary election, and 50% to the GELAC.</P>
      <P>(ii) <E T="03">Other communications.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the costs of a campaign communication that does not include a solicitation shall be attributed to the primary or general election limits based on the date on which the communication is broadcast, published or mailed. The cost of a communication that is broadcast, published or mailed before the date of the candidate's nomination shall be attributed to the primary election limits.</P>
      <P>(7) <E T="03">Travel costs.</E> Expenditures for campaign-related transportation, food, and lodging by any individual, including a candidate, shall be attributed according to when the travel occurs. If the travel occurs on or before the date of the candidate's nomination, the cost is a primary election expense. Travel to and from the convention shall be attributed to the primary election. Travel by a person who is working exclusively on general election campaign preparations shall be considered a general election expense even if the travel occurs before the candidate's nomination.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Net outstanding campaign obligations.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) Within 15 calendar days after the candidate's date of ineligibility, as determined under 11 CFR 9033.5, the candidate shall submit a statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. The candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations under this section equal the difference between paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section:</P>
      <P>(1) The total of all outstanding obligations for qualified campaign expenses as of the candidate's date of ineligibility as determined under 11 CFR 9033.5, plus estimated necessary winding down costs as defined under 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3), less</P>
      <P>(2) The total of:</P>

      <P>(i) Cash on hand as of the close of business on the last day of eligibility (including all contributions dated on or before that date whether or not submitted for matching; currency; balances on deposit in banks; savings and loan institutions; and other depository institutions; traveler's checks; certificates of deposit; treasury bills; and any <PRTPAGE P="254"/>other committee investments valued at fair market value);</P>
      <P>(ii) The fair market value of capital assets and other assets on hand; and</P>
      <P>(iii) Amounts owed to the committee in the form of credits, refunds of deposits, returns, receivables, or rebates of qualified campaign expenses; or a commercially reasonable amount based on the collectibility of those credits, returns, receivables or rebates.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Liabilities.</E> (1) The amount submitted as the total of outstanding campaign obligations under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not include any accounts payable for non-qualified campaign expenses nor any amounts determined or anticipated to be required as repayment under 11 CFR part 9038 or any amounts paid to secure a surety bond under 11 CFR 9038.5.</P>
      <P>(2) The amount submitted as estimated necessary winding down costs under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be broken down by expense category and quarterly or monthly time period. This breakdown shall include estimated costs for office space rental, staff salaries, legal expenses, accounting expenses, office supplies, equipment rental, telephone expenses, postage and other mailing costs, printing and storage. The breakdown shall estimate the costs that will be incurred in each category from the time the statement is submitted until the expected termination of the committee's political activity.</P>
      <P>(c)(1) <E T="03">Capital assets.</E> For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">capital asset</E> means any property used in the operation of the campaign whose purchase price exceeded $2000 when received by the committee. Property that must be valued as capital assets under this section includes, but is not limited to, office equipment, furniture, vehicles and fixtures acquired for use in the operation of the candidate's campaign, but does not include property defined as “other assets” under 11 CFR 9034.5(c)(2). A list of all capital assets shall be maintained by the Committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.11(d). The fair market value of capital assets shall be considered to be the total original cost of such items when acquired less 40%, to account for depreciation, except that items received after the date of ineligibility must be valued at their fair market value on the date received.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Other assets.</E> The term <E T="03">other assets</E> means any property acquired by the committee for use in raising funds or as collateral for campaign loans. “Other assets” must be included on the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations if the aggregate value of such assets exceeds $5000. The value of “other assets” shall be determined by the fair market value of each item on the candidate's date of ineligibility or on the date the item is acquired if acquired after the date of ineligibility. A list of other assets shall be maintained by the committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.11(d)(2).</P>
      <P>(d) <E T="03">Collectibility of accounts receivable.</E> If the committee determines that an account receivable of $500 or more, including any credit, refund, return or rebate, is not collectible in whole or in part, the committee shall demonstrate through documentation that the determination was commercially reasonable.

      <SUBJECT>Allocation of travel expenditures.</SUBJECT>

      <P>(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of 11 CFR 106.3, expenditures for travel relating to the campaign of a candidate seeking nomination for election to the office of President by any individual, including a candidate, shall, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of <PRTPAGE P="257"/>this section, be qualified campaign expenses and be reported by the candidate's authorized committee(s) as expenditures.</P>
      <P>(b)(1) For a trip which is entirely campaign-related, the total cost of the trip shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure.</P>
      <P>(2) For a trip which includes campaign-related and non-campaign related stops, that portion of the cost of the trip allocable to campaign activity shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure. Such portion shall be determined by calculating what the trip would have cost from the point of origin of the trip to the first campaign-related stop and from that stop through each subsequent campaign-related stop, back to the point of origin. If any campaign activity, other than incidental contacts, is conducted at a stop, that stop shall be considered campaign-related. Campaign activity includes soliciting, making, or accepting contributions, and expressly advocating the election or defeat of the candidate. Other factors, including the setting, timing and statements or expressions of the purpose of an event and the substance of the remarks or speech made, will also be considered in determining whether a stop is campaign-related.</P>
      <P>(3) For each trip, an itinerary shall be prepared and such itinerary shall be made available by the committee for Commission inspection. The itinerary shall show the time of arrival and departure and the type of event held.</P>
      <P>(4) For trips by government conveyance or by charter, a list of all passengers on such trip, along with a designation of which passengers are and which are not campaign-related, shall be made available for Commission inspection. When required to be created, a copy of the government's or the charter company's official manifest shall also be maintained and made available by the committee.</P>
      <P>(5)(i) If any individual, including a candidate, uses a government airplane for campaign-related travel, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to:</P>
      <P>(A) The lowest unrestricted and non-discounted first class commercial air fare available for the time traveled, in the case of travel to a city served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline service; or</P>
      <P>(B) The lowest unrestricted and non-discounted coach commercial air fare available for the time traveled, in the case of travel to a city served by regularly scheduled coach airline service, but not regularly scheduled first class airline service; or</P>
      <P>(C) In the case of travel to a city not served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline service, the commercial charter rate for an airplane sufficient in size to accommodate the campaign-related travelers, including the candidate, plus the news media and the Secret Service.</P>
      <P>(ii) If a government airplane is flown to a campaign-related stop where it will pick up passengers, or from a campaign-related stop where it left off passengers, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the greater of the amount billed or the amount required under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section for one passenger.</P>
      <P>(iii) If any individual, including a candidate, uses a government conveyance, other than an airplane, for campaign-related travel, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the commercial rental rate for a conveyance sufficient in size to accommodate the campaign-related travelers, including the candidate, plus the news media and the Secret Service.</P>
      <P>(iv) If any individual, including a candidate, uses accommodations, including lodging and meeting rooms, during campaign-related travel, and the accommodations are paid for by a government entity, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the usual and normal charge for the accommodations, and shall maintain documentation supporting the amount paid.</P>

      <P>(v) For travel by airplane, the committee shall maintain documentation of the lowest unrestricted nondiscounted air fare available for the time traveled, including the airline, the <PRTPAGE P="258"/>flight number and travel service providing that fare or the charter rate, as appropriate. For travel by other conveyances, the committee shall maintain documentation of the commercial rental rate for a conveyance of sufficient size, including the provider of the conveyance and the size, model and make of the conveyance.</P>
      <P>(6) Travel expenses of a candidate's spouse and family when accompanying the candidate on campaign-related travel may be treated as qualified campaign expenses and reportable expenditures. If the spouse or family members conduct campaign-related activities, their travel expenses will be treated as qualified campaign expenses and reportable expenditures.</P>
      <P>(7) If any individual, including a candidate, incurs expenses for campaign-related travel, other than by use of government conveyance or accommodations, an amount equal to that portion of the actual cost of the conveyance or accommodations which is allocable to all passengers, including the candidate, who are traveling for campaign purposes will be a qualified campaign expense and shall be reported by the committee as an expenditure.</P>
      <P>(i) If the trip is by charter, the actual cost for each passenger shall be determined by dividing the total operating cost for the charter by the total number of passengers transported. The amount which is a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9034.7(b)(2) on the basis of the actual cost per passenger multiplied by the number of passengers traveling for campaign purposes.</P>
      <P>(ii) If the trips is by non-charter commercial transportation, the actual cost shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9034.7(b)(2) on the basis of the commercial fare. Such actual cost shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure.</P>
      <P>(8) Travel on corporate airplanes and other corporate conveyances is governed by 11 CFR 114.9(e).</P>

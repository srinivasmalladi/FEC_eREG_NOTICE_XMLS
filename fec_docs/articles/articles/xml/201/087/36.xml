        <P>The Commission is promulgating new rules to implement the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (&#x201C;DCIA&#x201D;), Public Law 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321-358. The DCIA governs the Federal government's debt collection activities, and mandates that all nontax debts or claims owed to the United States that have been delinquent for a period of 180 days shall be referred to the U.S. Department of the Treasury or a Treasury-designated collection center for appropriate action to collect or terminate collection of the claim or debt. 31 U.S.C. 3711(g)(1). The purposes of the DCIA are: (1) To maximize collections of delinquent debts owed to the Government by ensuring quick action to enforce recovery of debts and the use of all appropriate collection tools; (2) to minimize the costs of debt collection by consolidating related functions and activities and using interagency teams; (3) to reduce losses arising from debt management activity by requiring proper screening of potential borrowers, aggressive monitoring of all accounts, and sharing of information within and among Federal agencies; (4) to ensure that the public is fully informed of the Federal government's debt collection policies and that debtors are aware of their obligations to repay amounts owed to the Federal government; (5) to ensure that debtors have all appropriate due process rights, including the ability to verify, challenge, and compromise claims, and access to administrative appeals procedures that are both reasonable and protect the interests of the United States; (6) to encourage agencies, when appropriate, to sell delinquent debt, particularly debts with underlying collateral; and (7) to rely on the experience and expertise of private sector professionals to provide debt collection services to Federal agencies. Public Law 104-134, sec. 31001(b), 110 Stat. 1321-358, 1321-358.</P>

        <P>The Federal Claims Collection Standards (&#x201C;FCCS&#x201D;), 31 CFR parts 900-904, were promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Department of Justice. The FCCS prescribes the standards that Federal agencies must use in the administrative collection, offset, compromise, and suspension or termination of collection activity for civil claims of money, funds, or property as defined by 31 U.S.C. 3701(b). The FCCS applies unless more specific Federal statutes or agency regulations apply, and in certain cases involving bankruptcy. The FCCS clarifies and simplifies Federal debt collection procedures, and prescribes the steps that an agency must take before initiating debt collection to ensure that individuals' rights are protected. These steps include notifying the debtor of the debt and the consequences of failing to resolve the debt.<E T="03">See</E>31 CFR 901.2. The FCCS provides agencies with limited discretion to adopt agency-specific regulations, tailored to the legal and policy requirements applicable to various types of Federal debt.</P>
        <P>The new regulations incorporate the provisions of the DCIA and the FCCS, in some instances directly, and in other instances by cross-reference.</P>

        <P>The Commission published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on February 24, 2010.<E T="03">See</E>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Collection of Administrative Debts; Collection of Debts Arising From Enforcement and Administration of Campaign Finance Laws, 75 FR 8274 (February 24, 2010) (the &#x201C;NPRM&#x201D;). The comment period closed on March 26, 2010. The Commission received one comment in response to the proposed rules.<SU>1</SU>

        </FTNT>

        <P>Under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d), and the Congressional Review of Agency Rulemaking Act, 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(1), agencies must submit final rules to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, and publish them in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>at least thirty calendar days before they take effect. The final rules that follow were transmitted to Congress on April 12, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Explanation and Justification</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. 11 CFR Part 8&#x2014;Collection of Administrative Debts</HD>

        <P>The Commission is adding new part 8 and new subpart C to part 111 of its regulations to provide for debt collection. The two provisions taken together are designed to cover all types of debt that the Commission must collect. The approach of separating the two general categories of debt in the regulations at 11 CFR part 8 and 11 CFR part 111 subpart C is for the convenience of the reader. Placing provisions concerning the collection of debts arising from the Commission's enforcement of the campaign finance laws in 11 CFR part 111 is consistent with the current placement of the regulations for collecting Administrative Fines debts with the enforcement provisions of part 111; placing the other debt collection provisions in 11 CFR part 8 also enables general administrative provisions to be located together.<PRTPAGE P="19874"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. 11 CFR 8.1&#x2014;Purpose and Scope</HD>
        <P>Section 8.1 of 11 CFR provides that the purpose of the regulations is to apply the collection standards set out in the DCIA and the FCCS.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. 11 CFR 8.2&#x2014;Debts That Are Covered</HD>
        <P>Section 8.2 of 11 CFR states that the new Commission regulations in part 8 cover only those debts that are either owed by current and former Commission employees, or arise from the provision of goods or services by contractors or vendors doing business with the Commission. The regulations in part 8 do not cover debts arising from compliance matters, administrative fines, alternative dispute resolution, repayments of public funds, and court judgments arising from the Commission's enforcement of the campaign finance laws, which are covered in new 11 CFR part 111 subpart C. Section 8.2 mirrors 11 CFR 111.51. The Commission's regulations also do not cover other types of debt that are specifically excluded from the FCCS, such as debts involving criminal actions of fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any other person having an interest in the claim, and debts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. 11 CFR 8.3&#x2014;Administrative Collection of Claims</HD>

        <P>Section 8.3 of 11 CFR states that the Commission will collect the claims or debts covered by 11 CFR part 8 in accordance with the FCCS, and adopts by cross-reference the relevant provisions of the DCIA, and U.S. Department of the Treasury and Department of Justice debt collection regulations.<E T="03">See</E>31 U.S.C. 3701<E T="03">et seq.;</E>31 CFR 285.2, 285.4, 285.7, 285.11, and parts 900-904. Proposed section 8.3 stated that the Commission will refer debts to the U.S. Department of the Treasury for collection no later than 180 days after the debts become delinquent. The final rule states that the Commission will refer all debts that are more than 180 days delinquent to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and may, at its discretion, transfer delinquent debts prior to the end of the 180 day period. This clarifies that the Commission need not complete the referral process to Treasury within the 180 day period. Instead, the Commission is required to transfer debts that are more than 180 days delinquent, and has the discretion to transfer debts before they are 180 days delinquent. The rule includes examples of collection actions that the U.S. Department of the Treasury might take: referral to another debt collection center, referral to a private collection contractor, or referral to the Department of Justice for litigation. These examples are taken from the U.S. Department of the Treasury regulation governing the transfer of debts to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and are not a comprehensive list of the actions that the U.S. Department of the Treasury may take in collecting such debt.<E T="03">See</E>31 CFR 285.12(c)(2). During the 180 days before the mandatory transfer of a debt to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Commission may take any action under these rules to attempt to collect the debt.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. 11 CFR 8.4&#x2014;Bankruptcy Claims</HD>
        <P>Section 8.4 of 11 CFR recognizes that in cases where a debtor has sought protection under the Bankruptcy Code, the Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 553, may require the Commission to take different action from that prescribed under the debt collection regulations set forth in part 8 and the FCCS. In these situations, bankruptcy law will govern the debt collection process.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. 11 CFR 8.5&#x2014;Interest, Penalties, and Administrative Costs</HD>
        <P>Section 8.5 of 11 CFR states that the Commission shall assess interest, penalties, and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States, in accordance with Federal law. The Commission shall waive collection of interest and administrative costs on debts or portions of debts that are paid within thirty days after the date on which interest begins to accrue.</P>
        <P>The regulation also provides that the Commission may, at its discretion, waive collection of interest, penalties, or administrative costs on any debt, even debts that are not paid within thirty days after the date on which interest begins to accrue. The regulation states that the Commission may waive collection of interest, penalties, or administrative costs if it determines that: (1) Collection is against equity and good conscience or is not in the best interest of the United States, including when an administrative offset or installment agreement is in effect; or, (2) waiver is appropriate under the criteria for compromise of debts set forth at 31 CFR 902.2(a).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Removal of 11 CFR 111.45</HD>
        <P>The Commission has removed the provision previously located at 11 CFR 111.45. This provision governed debt collection with respect to the Administrative Fines program. Under the new regulations, these debts are covered by 11 CFR part 111 subpart C&#x2014;Collection of Debts Arising from Enforcement and Administration of Campaign Finance Laws.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. 11 CFR Part 111 Subpart C&#x2014;Collection of Debts Arising From Enforcement and Administration of Campaign Finance Laws</HD>

        <P>The regulations in 11 CFR part 111 subpart C govern the Commission's collection of debts arising from compliance matters, administrative fines, alternative dispute resolution, repayments of public funds, and court judgments arising from the Commission's enforcement of the campaign finance laws. The regulations cover the collection of debts only, and will be invoked only after the completion of existing Commission processes during which respondents or other parties have had a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate that no civil penalty or repayment should be imposed.<E T="03">See</E>11 CFR parts 111 and 9038, and 9008.11-9008.15.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. 11 CFR 111.50&#x2014;Purpose and Scope</HD>
        <P>Section 111.50 of 11 CFR provides that the purpose of the regulations is to apply the collection standards set out in the DCIA and the FCCS. This provision treats debts under 11 CFR part 111 in a similar manner to those owed by employees and vendors under 11 CFR 8.1, discussed above.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. 11 CFR 111.51&#x2014;Debts That Are Covered</HD>

        <P>Section 111.51 of 11 CFR states that the new Commission regulations in  11 CFR part 111 subpart C cover only those debts arising from compliance matters, administrative fines, alternative dispute resolution, repayments of public funds, and court judgments arising from the Commission's enforcement and administration of the campaign finance laws. The regulations in 11 CFR part 111 subpart C do not cover debts either owed by current and former Commission employees, or arising from the provision of goods or services by contractors or vendors doing business with the Commission, which are covered by new 11 CFR part 8. This new provision treats debts under 11 CFR part 111 in a similar manner to those owed by employees and vendors under new 11 CFR 8.2, and the two provisions taken together are designed to cover all types of debt that the Commission must collect. The Commission's regulations also do not cover other types of debt that are specifically excluded from the FCCS, such as debts involving criminal actions of fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any other person<PRTPAGE P="19875"/>having an interest in the claim, and debts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. 11 CFR 111.52&#x2014;Administrative Collection of Claims</HD>

        <P>Section 111.52 of 11 CFR states that the Commission will collect all claims or debts in accordance with the FCCS, and adopts by cross-reference the relevant DCIA, U.S. Department of the Treasury, and U.S. Department of Justice debt collection provisions.<E T="03">See</E>31 U.S.C. 3701<E T="03">et seq.;</E>31 CFR 285.2, 285.4, 285.7, 285.11, and parts 900-904. This provision treats the debts covered by new 11 CFR part 111 subpart C in a similar manner to those owed by employees and vendors under new 11 CFR 8.3, discussed above. The proposed provision stated that the Commission will refer debts to the U.S. Department of the Treasury for collection no later than 180 days after the debt becomes delinquent. The final rule states that the Commission will refer all debts that are more than 180 days delinquent to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and may, at its discretion, transfer delinquent debts prior to the end of the 180 day period. This clarifies that the Commission need not complete the referral process to Treasury within the 180 day period. Instead, the Commission is required to transfer debts that are more than 180 days delinquent, and has the discretion to transfer debts before they are 180 days delinquent. The rule includes examples of collection actions that the U.S. Department of the Treasury might take: referral to another debt collection center, or referral to a private collection contractor.

During the 180 days before the mandatory transfer of a debt to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Commission may take any action under these rules, or may go to court under the Commission's litigating authority in 31 U.S.C. 437g to attempt to collect the debt.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. 11 CFR 111.53&#x2014;Litigation by the Commission</HD>
        <P>Section 111.53 of 11 CFR states that nothing in the debt collection procedures precludes the Commission from filing suit under 2 U.S.C. 437g to enforce compliance with a conciliation agreement, seek a civil money penalty, petition the court for a contempt order, or otherwise exercise its authority to enforce or administer the campaign finance laws and regulations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. 11 CFR 111.54&#x2014;Bankruptcy Claims</HD>

        <P>Section 111.54 of 11 CFR recognizes that in cases where a debtor has sought protection under the Bankruptcy Code, the Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 362, may require the Commission to take different action from that prescribed under the debt collection regulations set forth in part 111 and the FCCS. In this event, bankruptcy law will govern the debt collection process.<E T="03">See</E>31 CFR 901.3(a)(5).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. 11 CFR 111.55&#x2014;Interest, Penalties, and Administrative Costs</HD>

        <P>Section 111.55 of 11 CFR states that the Commission shall assess interest, penalties, and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States, as required by Federal law.<E T="03">See</E>31 U.S.C. 3717. The Commission shall waive collection of interest and administrative costs on debts or portions of debts that are paid within thirty days after the date on which interest begins to accrue.</P>

The regulation states that the Commission may waive collection of interest, penalties, or administrative costs if it determines that: (1) Collection is against equity and good conscience or is not in the best interest of the United States, including when an administrative offset or installment agreement is in effect; or, (2) waiver is appropriate under the criteria for compromise of debts set forth at 31 CFR 902.2(a).

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Certification of No Effect Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (Regulatory Flexibility Act)</HD>
        <P>The attached final rules do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. There are two bases for this certification. First, the attached final rules implement statutorily required processes for collecting unpaid debts, and any economic impact of these rules is caused by the statutory mandate, rather than agency decisions contained in these rules. Second, the provisions in the new rules relate to agency management and procedure and do not impose new substantive or compliance requirements directly on members of the public. If the provision regarding the imposition of interest, penalties, and administrative costs could be viewed as imposing a new requirement on the public, the regulation merely implements the statutory requirement that the Commission assess these additional costs and provides that the Commission can exercise its discretion to waive the assessment of such costs in appropriate circumstances. Thus, any incremental economic impact of this rule on small entities is not significant. Therefore, the Commission certifies that the attached final rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>

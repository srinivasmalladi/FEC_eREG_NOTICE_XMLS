        <P>The Federal Election Commission (&#x201C;Commission&#x201D;) has received a Petition for Rulemaking from the Center for Individual Freedom. The petitioner asks that the Commission revise 11 CFR 104.20(c)(8) and (9) &#x201C;by deleting the phrase `pursuant to 11 CFR 114.15,' thereby explicitly applying the electioneering communication disclosure obligations of corporations and labor unions to any form of electioneering communication.&#x201D; The Commission seeks comments on the petition.</P>

        <P>Copies of the Petition for Rulemaking are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Records Office, 999 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20463, Monday through Friday between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., and on the Commission's Web site,<E T="03">http://www.fec.gov/fosers/</E>(REG 2012-01 Electioneering Communications Reporting (2012)).

        <P>The Federal Election Commission published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on December 27, 2002, Notice 2002-30 to delay the effective date of the revisions to 11 CFR 110.9 contained in the Contribution Limitations and Prohibitions; Final Rule. 67 FR 78959;<E T="03">see also</E>67 FR 69928 (November 19, 2002) (Contribution Limitations and Prohibitions; Final Rule). Due to a typographical error, Notice 2002-30 incorrectly stated that the delayed effective date for revised 11 CFR 110.9 would be January 13, 2002 rather than January 13, 2003. Consequently, this Notice corrects the delayed effective date for revised 11 CFR 110.9 to January 13, 2003.</P>

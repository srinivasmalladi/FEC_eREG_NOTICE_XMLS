These final rules included a technical amendment to 11 CFR 111.45 to correct a citation to the Federal Claims Collection Standards (&#x201C;the Standards&#x201D;) in response to the revision and recodification of the Standards after the original Administrative Fines regulations were published in May 2000. In the March 17, 2003,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>publication, instruction number 4 incorrectly identified &#x201C;General Accounting Office&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;Government Accounting Office&#x201D; as the language that is removed from 11 CFR 111.45.</P>

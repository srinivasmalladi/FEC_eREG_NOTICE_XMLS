          <P>The recently enacted Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (&#x201C;BCRA&#x201D;) substantially amended the Federal Election Campaign Act (&#x201C;FECA&#x201D; or &#x201C;the Act&#x201D;). Among its amendments is the deletion of the office building or facility exception in the definition of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; in section 431(8)(B) of FECA. The Federal Election Commission (&#x201C;the Commission&#x201D;) is amending the regulations to reflect this statutory change. As part of this effort, the Commission is also reorganizing the sections defining &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure&#x201D; in its regulations. Further information is provided in the supplementary information that follows.</P>

        <P>The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, Public Law 107-155, 116 Stat. 81 (March 27, 2002), significantly amends the Federal Elections Campaign Act, as amended, 2 U.S.C. 431<E T="03">et seq.,</E>and directs the Commission to promulgate regulations implementing Title I of BCRA within 90 days of enactment and to promulgate regulations implementing the other titles of BCRA that are under the Commission's jurisdiction within 270 days of enactment.<E T="03">See</E>BCRA, section 402(c). One amendment to the definition of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; is in Title I, section 103(b)(1) of BCRA. These final rules address this amendment.<PRTPAGE P="50583"/>
        </P>

        <P>Section 103(b)(1) of BCRA deletes current 2 U.S.C. 431(8)(B)(viii), thus eliminating the office building or facility exception from the definition of &#x201C;contribution.&#x201D; Congress in BCRA also amended 2 U.S.C. 453 to prescribe that &#x201C;notwithstanding any other provision of the Act, a State or local committee if a political party may, subject to State law, use exclusively funds that are not subject to the prohibitions, limitations, and reporting requirements of the Act for the purchase or construction of an office building for such State or local committee.&#x201D; In these final rules, the Commission amends the definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure&#x201D; to comply with these amendments. The Commission has promulgated separate final rules to address the impact of this statutory change on State and local party committees, as well as other changes from BCRA Title I.<E T="03">See</E>Explanation and Justification of &#x201C;Prohibited and Excessive Contributions: Non-Federal Funds or Soft Money&#x201D; (&#x201C;Non-Federal Funds Final Rules&#x201D;), 67 FR part II (July 29, 2002).</P>
        <P>This rulemaking is one in a series of rulemakings that the Commission will undertake to implement the various provisions of BCRA. The other separate rulemakings will address: (1) Electioneering communications; (2) coordinated and independent expenditures; (3) the so-called &#x201C;millionaires&#x201D; amendment,&#x201D; which increases contribution limits for congressional candidates facing self-financed candidates on a sliding scale, based on the amount of personal funds the opponent contributes to his or her campaign; (4) the limitations and prohibition on contributions including the increase in contribution limits, and the ban on contributions by minors and foreign nationals; (5) other provisions, including inaugural committees; fraudulent solicitations; disclaimers; personal use of campaign funds; (6) reporting; and (7) BCRA's impact on national nominating conventions.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Commission is reorganizing 11 CFR 100.7 and 100.8 to facilitate locating and reading the definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure,&#x201D; and the exceptions to both definitions.</P>

        <P>Under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d), and the Congressional Review of Agency Rulemaking Act, 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(1), agencies must submit final rules to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate and publish them in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>at least 30 calendar days before they take effect. The final rules on Reorganization of Regulations on &#x201C;Contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;Expenditure&#x201D; were transmitted to Congress on July 26, 2002.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Explanation and Justification</HD>

        <P>The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (&#x201C;NPRM&#x201D;) on which these final rules are based was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on June 14, 2002. 67 FR 40881 (June 14, 2002). The Commission received comments from The Campaign and Media Legal Center; Center for Responsive Politics; Common Cause and Democracy 21 (joint comment); Senators John McCain and Russell D. Feingold, and Representatives Christopher Shays and Marty Meehan; and Ms. Cynthia Minchillo-Synhort, RP. The Commission did not hold a hearing on the NPRM, and none of the commenters requested an opportunity to testify.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Non-Federal Funds Final Rules Effect on 11 CFR 100.7 and 100.8</HD>
        <P>The NPRM raised the possibility of the Commission addressing, as part of the Non-Federal Funds Final Rules, changes to the definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure.&#x201D; The NPRM also stated that any changes to these definitions in the Non-Federal Funds Final Rules would be incorporated into these final rules. Several commenters, including the principal Congressional sponsors of BCRA, expressed concern that the Commission had acted &#x201C;prematurely&#x201D; in undertaking this reorganization rulemaking at a time when the soft money rulemaking was not completed. These commenters stated that conforming amendments to the definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure&#x201D; may be substantive in nature or have substantive impact. They argued that the Commission should issue a new NPRM with proposed regulatory text for the conforming amendments and seek comments before promulgating the final rules.</P>

        <P>This rulemaking does not make substantive changes to the current definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditures&#x201D; to conform to the Non-Federal Funds Final Rules. The NPRM contemplated that if the Non-Federal Funds Final Rules included amendments to 11 CFR 100.7 and 100.8, those amendments would be included in these final rules, similar to the way in which in the Brokerage Loans and Lines of Credit final rules are being incorporated in this reorganization.<E T="03">See</E>below.</P>
        <P>However, because the Commission's regulations in the Non-Federal Funds Final Rules do not change the definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; or &#x201C;expenditure,&#x201D; the Commission's statements in the NPRM about the possibility of the soft money rulemaking affecting these final rules are moot. Other than the reorganization and the changes discussed below, these final rules do not amend the substantive definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure.&#x201D;</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Other BCRA Provisions That Affect the Definition of &#x201C;Contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;Expenditure&#x201D;</HD>

        <P>Several commenters noted that other provisions in BCRA affect the definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure.&#x201D; The Commission recognizes that rules implementing the rest of BCRA may require amendments to these definitions. Such changes, however, will be the subject of separate rulemakings described above. The public will receive full notice and an opportunity to comment on the Commission's proposed rules on the implementation of such changes. This final rule, however, makes preparations for the separate rulemakings that may amend the definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure.&#x201D; The structure of current 11 CFR 100.7 and 100.8 is difficult to amend in a clear and comprehensive manner. By reorganizing the rules contained in these two sections into multiple sections, subsequent amendments, in subsequent rulemakings, will be easier for the Commission to incorporate, and easier for the public to identify, comment on, and ultimately use.<E T="03">See</E>discussion about reorganization, below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">&#x201C;Allocation&#x201D; Versus &#x201C;Attribution&#x201D;</HD>
        <P>In the NPRM, the Commission raised the possibility of changing the use of the word &#x201C;allocation&#x201D; or any of its derivatives to &#x201C;attribution&#x201D; or one of its derivatives, and sought comment on this possibility. The proposed rules did not reflect such proposed change. The comments the Commission received on this suggestion did not support this proposed change. One public interest group questioned what such a change would accomplish. Several commenters stated that the necessity for clarification around &#x201C;allocation&#x201D; in the rules requires more than a word change, especially in the area of exempt activities. They argued that the allocation provisions in the Non-Federal Funds Final Rules at 11 CFR parts 100 and 300 have direct impact on this issue. They urged the Commission to amend the definitions to reflect the new allocation rules.</P>

        <P>In response to those concerns, the final rules do not replace &#x201C;allocation&#x201D; and its derivatives with &#x201C;attribution&#x201D; or its derivative. As was emphasized in the new Non-Federal Funds Final Rules and<PRTPAGE P="50584"/>Explanation and Justification, exempt activities conducted in conjunction with Non-Federal activities that are not Federal election activities are governed by 11 CFR 106.1 and 106.7. To the extent that these activities do constitute Federal election activities, however, they must be allocated between Federal funds and Levin funds pursuant to new 11 CFR part 300. Nothing in this reorganization of the &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure&#x201D; definitions changes the use of Federal, non-Federal, or Levin funds for the payment of any exempt activities. To clarify this, a cross-reference to the new allocation rules in 11 CFR 100.24, 104.17(a), and part 300, subparts B, D, and/ or E has been added in the final rules in 11 CFR 100.80 (slate cards and sample ballots), 100.87 (volunteer activity for party committees), 100.88 (volunteer activity for candidates), 100.89 (voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities for Presidential candidates), 100.140 (slate cards and sample ballots), 100.147 (volunteer activity for party committees), 100.148 (volunteer activity for candidates), and 100.149 (voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities for Presidential candidates).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Reorganization of Current 11 CFR 100.7 and 100.8</HD>
        <P>The Commission is reorganizing 11 CFR 100.7 and 100.8 in these final rules. The reorganizing makes it easier to locate and read the definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure&#x201D; and the detailed exceptions to those definitions. Three commenters, including the principal Congressional sponsors of BCRA, expressed support for, and encouraged, this reorganization to make the rules more &#x201C;user friendly&#x201D; and &#x201C;easier to read and understand.&#x201D;</P>
        <P>The new rules create four new subparts, B through E, within 11 CFR part 100 which contain the definitions of, and exceptions to, &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure.&#x201D; Subpart B contains sections describing items that are contributions; subpart C contains sections describing items that are not contributions; subpart D contains sections describing items that are expenditures; and subpart E contains sections describing items that are not expenditures. The distribution table attached to these final rules lists where the various paragraphs of 11 CFR 100.7 and 100.8 can now be found within these new subparts.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Inclusion of &#x201C;Brokerage Loans and Lines of Credit&#x201D;</HD>

        <P>The final rules also incorporate another recent change to FECA&#x2014;the inclusion of a loan of money derived from an advance on a candidate's brokerage account, credit card, home equity line of credit, or other line of credit available to the candidate as an item that is not a contribution. The Commission published the final rules, entitled &#x201C;Brokerage Loans and Lines of Credit,&#x201D; to amend 11 CFR 100.7(b) and 100.8(b) to include these types of loans as exceptions to the definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure.&#x201D;<E T="03">See</E>67 FR 38353 (June 4, 2002). The language in this final rule at 11 CFR 100.83 and 100.144 reflects the language in the &#x201C;Brokerage Loans and Lines of Credit&#x201D; final rules. The Commission received no comment on this incorporation of the rules from a previous rulemaking.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Amendments to the Office Building or Facility Exceptions</HD>
        <P>Current 11 CFR 100.7(b)(12) and 100.8(b)(13) designate that the construction or purchase of an office building or facility are exceptions to the definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure.&#x201D; New 11 CFR 100.56 (stating that a contribution to national party committees for the construction or purchase of an office building or facility is a &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; under the Act) and 100.114 (stating that an expenditures by a national party committees for the construction or purchase of an office building or facility is an &#x201C;expenditure&#x201D; under the Act) make clear that these exceptions no longer apply to national party committees. Similarly, in light of BCRA's amendment of 2 U.S.C. 453, new 11 CFR 100.84 and 100.144 make clear that the office building or facility exceptions still apply to State, local, and district party committees, subject to the provisions of 11 CFR 300.34. The final rules reflect the language proposed in the NPRM. The Commission received no comment on its proposed changes implementing BCRA's deletion of the office building or facility exception.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Grammatical and Technical Revisions</HD>
        <P>In addition to nonsubstantive grammatical corrections, minor technical revisions have been made to reflect the reorganization structure. Also, a cross-reference in paragraph (f) of section 100.142 has been corrected, now directing the reader to the other bank loan provisions. Other substantive changes to the definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure&#x201D; will take place in separate rulemakings.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Other Comments</HD>

        <P>One commenter criticized the NPRM in general, but made no specific comment or suggestion. Another commenter advocated the complete, or at least partial, elimination of the exception to the definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure&#x201D; for recounts and election contests, on the basis that recounts and election contests, which are not Federal elections as defined by the Act,<E T="03">see generally Federal Election Regulations,</E>H. R. Doc. No. 44, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. at 40 (1977) (<E T="03">FEC EJ Compilation</E>at 38, 42), &#x201C;serve as an avenue for the use of soft money to influence federal elections,&#x201D; as evidenced by unregulated contributions used to pay for the 2000 Florida recount. This change is beyond the scope of this rulemaking dealing only with nonsubstantive changes, with the exception of the deletion of the office building or facility exception for national parties.</P>

        <P>The attached final rules do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is based on that fact that the final rules' only substantive change, eliminating the office building or facility exceptions to the definitions of &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;expenditure&#x201D; for national party committees, affects only national party committees. The national party committees of the two major political parties are not small entities under 5 U.S.C. 601.

              <P>(a) The term<E T="03">contribution</E>includes the payments, services, or other things of value described in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purpose of this subpart, a contribution or payment made by an individual shall not be attributed to any other individual, unless otherwise specified by that other individual in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Gift, subscription, loan, advance or deposit of money.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A gift, subscription, loan (except for a loan made in accordance with 11 CFR 100.72 and 100.73), advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office is a contribution.</P>
              <P>(b) For purposes of this section, the term<E T="03">loan</E>includes a guarantee, endorsement, and any other form of security.</P>
              <P>(1) A loan that exceeds the contribution limitations of 2 U.S.C. 441a and 11 CFR part 110 shall be unlawful whether or not it is repaid.</P>
              <P>(2) A loan is a contribution at the time it is made and is a contribution to the extent that it remains unpaid. The aggregate amount loaned to a candidate or committee by a contributor, when added to other contributions from that individual to that candidate or committee, shall not exceed the contribution limitations set forth at 11 CFR part 110. A loan, to the extent it is repaid, is no longer a contribution.</P>
              <P>(3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a loan is a contribution by each endorser or guarantor. Each endorser or guarantor shall be deemed to have contributed that portion of the total amount of the loan for which he or she agreed to be liable in a written agreement. Any reduction in the unpaid balance of the loan shall reduce proportionately the amount endorsed or guaranteed by each endorser or guarantor in such written agreement. In the event that such agreement does not stipulate the portion of the loan for which each endorser or guarantor is liable, the loan shall be considered a loan by each endorser or guarantor in the same proportion to the unpaid balance that each endorser or guarantor bears to the total number of endorsers or guarantors.</P>
              <P>(4) A candidate may obtain a loan on which his or her spouse's signature is required when jointly owned assets are used as collateral or security for the loan. The spouse shall not be considered a contributor to the candidate's campaign if the value of the candidate's share of the property used as collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the loan that is used for the candidate's campaign.</P>
              <P>(5) If a political committee makes a loan to any person, such loan shall be subject to the limitations of 11 CFR part 110. Repayment of the principal amount of such loan to such political committee shall not be a contribution by the debtor to the lender committee. Such repayment shall be made with funds that are subject to the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.4(a) and part 114. The payment of interest to such committee by the debtor shall be a contribution only to the extent that the interest paid exceeds a commercially reasonable rate prevailing at the time the loan is made. All payments of interest shall be made from funds subject to the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.4(a) and part 114.</P>
              <P>(c) For purposes of this section, the term<E T="03">money</E>includes currency of the United States or of any foreign nation, checks, money orders, or any other negotiable instruments payable on demand.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) For purposes of this section, the term<E T="03">anything of value</E>includes all in-kind contributions. Unless specifically exempted under 11 CFR part 100, subpart C, the provision of any goods or services without charge or at a charge that is less than the usual and normal charge for such goods or services is a contribution. Examples of such goods or services include, but are not limited to: Securities, facilities, equipment, supplies, personnel, advertising services, membership lists, and mailing lists. If goods or services are provided at less than the usual and normal charge, the amount of the in-kind contribution is the difference between the usual and normal charge for the goods or services at the time of the contribution and the amount charged the political committee.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section,<E T="03">usual and normal charge for goods</E>means the price of those goods in the market from which they ordinarily would have been purchased at the time of the contribution; and usual and normal charge for any services, other than those provided by an unpaid volunteer, means the hourly or piecework charge for the services at a commercially reasonable rate prevailing at the time the services were rendered.</P>

No compensation is considered paid to any employee under any of the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(a)<E T="03">Paid on an hourly or salaried basis.</E>If an employee is paid on an hourly or salaried basis and is expected to work a particular number of hours per period, no contribution results if the employee engages in political activity during what would otherwise be a regular work period, provided that the taken or released time is made up or completed by the employee within a reasonable time.</P>
              <P>(b)<E T="03">Paid on commission or piecework basis.</E>No contribution results where an employee engages in political activity during what would otherwise be normal working hours if the employee is paid on a commission or piecework basis, or is paid only for work actually performed and the employee's time is considered his or her own to use as he or she sees fit.</P>
              <P>(c)<E T="03">Vacation or earned leave time.</E>No contribution results where the time used by the employee to engage in political activity is bona fide, although compensable, vacation time or other earned leave time.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Extension of credit.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The extension of credit by any person is a contribution unless the credit is extended in the ordinary course of the person's business and the terms are substantially similar to extensions of credit to nonpolitical debtors that are of similar risk and size of obligation. If a creditor fails to make a commercially reasonable attempt to collect the debt, a contribution will result. (See 11 CFR 116.3 and 116.4.) If a debt owed by a political committee is forgiven or settled for less than the amount owed, a contribution results unless such debt is settled in accordance with the standards set forth at 11 CFR 116.3 and 116.4.</P>

Any reduction in the unpaid balance of the loan shall reduce proportionately the amount endorsed or guaranteed by each endorser or guarantor in such written agreement. In the event that such agreement does not stipulate the portion of the loan for which each endorser or guarantor is liable, the loan shall be considered a contribution by each endorser or guarantor in the same proportion to the unpaid balance that each endorser or guarantor bears to the total number of endorsers or guarantors.</P>

              <P>(1)(i) The lending institution making the loan has perfected a security interest in collateral owned by the candidate or political committee receiving the loan, the fair market value of the collateral is equal to or greater than the loan amount and any senior liens as determined on the date of the loan, and the candidate or political committee provides documentation to show that the lending institution has a perfected security interest in the collateral. Sources of collateral include, but are not limited to, ownership in real estate, personal property, goods, negotiable instruments, certificates of deposit, chattel papers, stocks, accounts receivable and cash on deposit.</P>
              <P>(ii) Amounts guaranteed by secondary sources of repayment, such as guarantors and cosigners, shall not exceed the contribution limits of 11 CFR part 110 or contravene the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.4, part 114 and part 115; or</P>

              <P>(2) The lending institution making the loan has obtained a written agreement whereby the candidate or political<PRTPAGE P="50589"/>committee receiving the loan has pledged future receipts, such as public financing payments under 11 CFR part 9001 through part 9012, or part 9031 through part 9039, contributions, or interest income, provided that:</P>

Any reduction in the unpaid balance of the loan shall reduce proportionately the amount endorsed or guaranteed by each endorser or guarantor in such written agreement. In the event that the loan agreement does not stipulate the portion of the loan for which each endorser or guarantor is liable, the loan shall be considered an expenditure by each endorser or guarantor in the same proportion to the unpaid balance that each endorser or guarantor bears to the total number of endorsers or guarantors.</P>

              <P>(2) The lending institution making the loan has obtained a written agreement whereby the candidate or political committee receiving the loan has pledged future receipts, such as public financing payments under 11 CFR part 9001 through part 9012 or part 9031 through 9039, contributions, or interest income, provided that:</P>

              <P>(iv) The loan agreement requires the deposit of the public financing payments, contributions, interest or other income pledged as collateral into the separate depository account for the purpose of retiring the debt according to the repayment requirements of the loan; and</P>
              <P>(v) In the case of public financing payments, the borrower authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to directly deposit the payments into the depository account for the purpose of retiring the debt.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Allocation of expenses between candidates.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> (1) Expenditures, including in-kind contributions, independent expenditures, and coordinated expenditures made on behalf of more than one clearly identified federal candidate shall be attributed to each such candidate according to the benefit reasonably expected to be derived. For example, in the case of a publication or broadcast communication, the attribution shall be determined by the proportion of space or time devoted to each candidate as compared to the total space or time devoted to all candidates. In the case of a fundraising program or event where funds are collected by one committee for more than one clearly identified candidate, the attribution shall be determined by the proportion of funds received by each candidate as compared to the total receipts by all candidates. These methods shall also be used to allocate payments involving both expenditures on behalf of one or more clearly identified federal candidates and disbursements on behalf of one or more clearly identified non-federal candidates.</P>
      <P>(2) An expenditure made on behalf of more than one clearly identified federal candidate shall be reported pursuant to 11 CFR 104.10(a). A payment that also includes amounts attributable to one or more non-federal candidates, and that is made by a political committee with separate federal and non-federal accounts, shall be made according to the procedures set forth in 11 CFR 106.5(g) or 106.6(e), as appropriate, but shall be reported pursuant to 11 CFR 104.10(a).</P>
      <P>(b) An authorized expenditure made by a candidate or political committee on behalf of another candidate shall be reported as a contribution in-kind (transfer) to the candidate on whose behalf the expenditure was made, except that expenditures made by party committees pursuant to § 110.7 need only be reported as an expenditure.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions:</E> (1) Expenditures for rent, personnel, overhead, general administrative, fund-raising, and other day-to-day costs of political committees need not be attributed to individual candidates, unless these expenditures are made on behalf of a clearly identified candidate and the expenditure can be directly attributed to that candidate.</P>
      <P>(2) Expenditures for educational campaign seminars, for training of campaign workers, and for registration or get-out-the-vote drives of committees need not be attributed to individual candidates unless these expenditures are made on behalf of a clearly identified candidate, and the expenditure can be directly attributed to that candidate.</P>
      <P>(3) Payments made for the cost of certain voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities conducted by State or local party organizations on behalf of any Presidential or Vice-Presidential candidate(s) are exempt from the definition of a contribution or an expenditure under 11 CFR 100.7(b)(17) and 100.8(b)(18). If the State or local party organization includes references to any candidate(s) seeking nomination or election to the House of Representatives or Senate of the United States the portion of the cost of such activities allocable to such candidate(s) shall be considered a contribution to or an expenditure on behalf of such candidate(s), unless such reference is incidental to the overall activity. If such reference is incidental to the overall activity, such costs shall not be considered a contribution to or expenditure on behalf of any candidate(s).</P>
      <P>(d) For purposes of this section, <E T="03">clearly identified</E> shall have the same meaning as set forth at 11 CFR 100.17.</P>

      <P>(e) Party committees, separate segregated funds, and nonconnected committees that make disbursements for <PRTPAGE P="103"/>administrative expenses, fundraising, exempt activities, or generic voter drives in connection with both federal and non-federal elections shall allocate their expenses in accordance with § 106.5 or § 106.6, as appropriate.

For purposes of this section, <E T="03">mass mailing</E> includes newsletters and other materials in which the content of the materials is substantially identical. Records supporting the committee's allocations under this section shall include: For each mass mailing, documentation showing the total number of pieces mailed and the number mailed to each state or zip code; and, for other campaign materials acquired for use outside the State of purchase, records relating to any shipping costs incurred for transporting these items to each State.</P>
      <P>(iii) <E T="03">Overhead expenditures</E>—(A) <E T="03">Overhead expenditures of State offices and other facilities.</E> Except for expenditures exempted under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(iii)(C), overhead expenditures of committee offices whose activities are directed at a particular State, and the costs of other facilities used for office functions and campaign events, shall be allocated to that State.

      <SUBJECT>Allocation of expenses between campaign and non-campaign related travel.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) This section applies to allocation for expenses between campaign and non-campaign related travel with respect to campaigns of candidates for Federal office, other than Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates who receive federal funds pursuant to 11 CFR part 9005 or 9036. (See 11 CFR 9004.7 and 9034.7) All expenditures for campaign-related travel paid for by a candidate from a campaign account or by his or her authorized committees or by any other political committee shall be reported.</P>
      <P>(b)(1) Travel expenses paid for by a candidate from personal funds, or from a source other than a political committee, shall constitute reportable expenditures if the travel is campaign-related.</P>
      <P>(2) Where a candidate's trip involves both campaign-related and non-campaign-related stops, the expenditures allocable for campaign purposes are reportable, and are calculated on the actual cost-per-mile of the means of transportation actually used, starting at the point of origin of the trip, via every campaign-related stop and ending at the point of origin.</P>
      <P>(3) Where a candidate conducts any campaign-related activity in a stop, the stop is a campaign-related stop and travel expenditures made are reportable. Campaign-related activity shall not include any incidental contacts.</P>

      <P>(c)(1) Where an individual, other than a candidate, conducts campaign-related activities on a trip, the portion of the trip attributed to each candidate shall be allocated on a reasonable basis.<PRTPAGE P="106"/>
      </P>
      <P>(2) Travel expenses of a candidate's spouse and family are reportable as expenditures only if the spouse or family members conduct campaign-related activities.</P>
      <P>(d) Costs incurred by a candidate for the United States Senate or House of Representatives for travel between Washington, DC, and the State or district in which he or she is a candidate need not be reported herein unless the costs are paid by a candidate's authorized committee(s), or by any other political committee(s).</P>

      <P>(e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the reportable expenditure for a candidate who uses government conveyance or accommodations for travel which is campaign-related is the rate for comparable commercial conveyance or accommodation. In the case of a candidate authorized by law or required by national security to be accompanied by staff and equipment, the allocable expenditures are the costs of facilities sufficient to accommodate the party, less authorized or required personnel and equipment. If such a trip includes both campaign and noncampaign stops, equivalent costs are calculated in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

      <SUBJECT>Allocation of polling expenses.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) The purchase of opinion poll results by a candidate or a candidate's authorized political committee or agent is an expenditure by the candidate. Regarding the purchase of opinion poll results for the purpose of determining whether an individual should become a candidate, see 11 CFR 100.8(b)(1).</P>
      <P>(b) The purchase of opinion poll results by a political committee or other person not authorized by a candidate to make expenditures and the subsequent acceptance of the poll results by a candidate or a candidate's authorized political committee or agent or by another unauthorized political committee is a contribution in-kind by the purchaser to the candidate or other political committee and an expenditure by the candidate or other political committee. Regarding the purchase of opinion poll results for the purpose of determining whether an individual should become a candidate, see 11 CFR 100.7(b)(1). The poll results are accepted by a candidate or other political committee if the candidate or the candidate's authorized political committee or agent or the other unauthorized political committee—</P>
      <P>(1) Requested the poll results before their receipt;</P>
      <P>(2) Uses the poll results; or</P>
      <P>(3) Does not notify the contributor that the results are refused.</P>
      <P>(c) The acceptance of any part of a poll's results which part, prior to receipt, has been made public without any request, authorization, prearrangement, or coordination by the candidate-receipient or political committee-recipient, shall not be treated as a contribution in-kind and expenditure under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
      <P>(d) The purchase of opinion poll results by an unauthorized political committee for its own use, in whole or in part, is an overhead expenditure by the political committee under § 106.1(c)(1) to the extent of the benefit derived by the committee.</P>
      <P>(e) The amount of a contribution under paragraph (b) of this section or of any expenditure under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section attributable to each candidate-recipient or political committee-recipient shall be—</P>
      <P>(1) That share of the overall cost of the poll which is allocable to each candidate (including State and local candidates) or political committee, based upon the cost allocation formula of the polling firm from which the results are purchased. Under this method the size of the sample, the number of computer column codes, the extent of computer tabulations, and the extent of written analysis and verbal consultation, if applicable, may be used to determine the shares; or</P>
      <P>(2) An amount computed by dividing the overall cost of the poll equally among candidates (including State and local candidates) or political committees receiving the results; or</P>

      <P>(3) A proportion of the overall cost of the poll equal to the proportion that the number of question results received <PRTPAGE P="107"/>by the candidate or political committee bears to the total number of question results received by all candidates (including State and local candidates) and political committees; or</P>
      <P>(4) An amount computed by any other method which reasonably reflects the benefit derived.</P>
      <P>(f) The first candidate(s) or committee(s) receiving poll results under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section and any candidate or political committee receiving poll results under paragraph (b) of this section within 15 days after receipt by the initial recipient(s) shall compute the amount of the contribution in-kind and the expenditure as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
      <P>(g) The amount of the contribution and expenditure reported by a candidate or a political committee receiving poll results under paragraph (b) of this section more than 15 days after receipt of such poll results by the initial recipient(s) shall be—</P>
      <P>(1) If the results are received during the period 16 to 60 days following receipt by the initial recipient(s), 50 percent of the amount allocated to an initial recipient of the same results;</P>
      <P>(2) If the results are received during the period 61 to 180 days after receipt by the initial recipient(s), 5 percent of the amount allocated to an initial recipient of the same results;</P>
      <P>(3) If the results are received more than 180 days after receipt by the initial recipient(s), no amount need be allocated.</P>
      <P>(h) A contributor of poll results under paragraph (b) of this section shall maintain records sufficient to support the valuation of the contribution(s) in-kind and shall inform the candidate-recipient(s) or political committee-recipient(s) of the value of the contribution(s).</P>

      <SUBJECT>Allocation of expenses between federal and non-federal activities by party committees.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">General rules.</E> (1) Party committees that make disbursements in connection with federal and non-federal elections shall make those disbursements entirely from funds subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the Act, or from accounts established pursuant to 11 CFR 102.5. Political committees that have established separate federal and non-federal accounts under 11 CFR 102.5(a)(1)(i) shall allocate expenses between those accounts according to this section. Organizations that are not political committees but have established separate federal and non-federal accounts under 11 CFR 102.5(b)(1)(i), or that make federal and non-federal disbursements from a single account under 11 CFR 102.5(b)(1)(ii) shall also allocate their federal and non-federal expenses according to this section. This section covers (i) general rules regarding allocation of federal and non-federal expenses by party committees, (ii) percentages to be allocated for administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives by national party committees, (iii) methods for allocation of administrative expenses, costs of generic voter drives, and exempt activities by state and local party committees, and of fundraising costs by all party committees, and (iv) procedures for payment of allocable expenses.

      <P>(ii) The direct costs of a fundraising program or event including disbursements for solicitation of funds and for planning and administration of actual fundraising events, where federal and non-federal funds are collected by one committee through such program or event;</P>

      <P>(iii) State and local party activities exempt from the definitions of <E T="03">contribution</E> and <E T="03">expenditure</E> under 11 CFR 100.7(b) (9), (15) or (17), and 100.8(b) (10), (16) or (18) (<E T="03">exempt activities</E>) including the production and distribution of slate cards and sample ballots, campaign materials distributed by volunteers, <PRTPAGE P="108"/>and voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives on behalf of the party's presidential and vice-presidential nominees, where such activities are conducted in conjunction with non-federal election activities; and</P>
      <P>(iv) Generic voter drives including voter identification, voter registration, and get-out-the-vote drives, or any other activities that urge the general public to register, vote or support candidates of a particular party or associated with a particular issue, without mentioning a specific candidate.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">National party committees other than Senate or House campaign committees; fixed percentages for allocating administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives—</E>(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Each national party committee other than a Senate or House campaign committee shall allocate a fixed percentage of its administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to its federal and non-federal account(s) each year. These percentages shall differ according to whether or not the allocable expenses were incurred in a presidential election year. Such committees shall allocate the costs of each combined federal and non-federal fundraising program or event according to paragraph (f) of this section, with no fixed percentages required.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Fixed percentages according to type of election year.</E> National party committees other than the Senate or House campaign committees shall allocate their administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives according to paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and (ii) as follows:</P>
      <P>(i) <E T="03">Presidential election years.</E> In presidential election years, national party committees other than the Senate or House campaign committees shall allocate to their federal accounts at least 65% each of their administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives.</P>
      <P>(ii) <E T="03">Non-presidential election years.</E> In all years other than presidential election years, national party committees other than the Senate or House campaign committees shall allocate to their federal accounts at least 60% each of their administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Senate and House campaign committees of a national party; method and minimum federal percentage for allocating administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives—</E>(1) <E T="03">Method for allocating administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives.</E> Subject to the minimum percentage set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, each Senate or House campaign committee of a national party shall allocate its administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to the funds expended method, described in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) as follows:</P>
      <P>(i) Under this method, expenses shall be allocated based on the ratio of federal expenditures to total federal and non-federal disbursements made by the committee during the two-year federal election cycle. This ratio shall be estimated and reported at the beginning of each federal election cycle, based upon the committee's federal and non-federal disbursements in a prior comparable federal election cycle or upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its disbursements for the coming two years. In calculating its federal expenditures, the committee shall include only amounts contributed to or otherwise spent on behalf of specific federal candidates. Calculation of total federal and non-federal disbursements shall also be limited to disbursements for specific candidates, and shall not include overhead or other generic costs.</P>
      <P>(ii) On each of its periodic reports, the committee shall adjust its allocation ratio to reconcile it with the ratio of actual federal and non-federal disbursements made, to date. If the non-federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall transfer funds from its federal to its non-federal account, as necessary, to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio. The committee shall make note of any such adjustments and transfers on its periodic reports, submitted pursuant to 11 CFR 104.5.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Minimum federal percentage for administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives.</E> Regardless of the allocation ratio calculated under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each Senate or <PRTPAGE P="109"/>House campaign committee of a national party shall allocate to its federal account at least 65% each of its administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives each year. If the committee's own allocation calculation under paragraph (c)(1) of this section yields a federal share greater than 65%, then the higher percentage shall be applied. If such calculation yields a federal share lower than 65%, then the committee shall report its calculated ratio according to 11 CFR 104.10(b), and shall apply the required minimum federal percentage.</P>
      <P>(3) <E T="03">Allocation of fundraising costs.</E> Senate and House campaign committees shall allocate the costs of each combined federal and non-federal fundraising program or event according to paragraph (f) of this section, with no minimum percentages required.</P>
      <P>(d) <E T="03">State and local party committees; method for allocating administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives—</E>(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> All state and local party committees except those covered by paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall allocate their administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to the ballot composition method, described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) as follows:</P>
      <P>(i) Under this method, expenses shall be allocated based on the ratio of federal offices expected on the ballot to total federal and non-federal offices expected on the ballot in the next general election to be held in the committee's state or geographic area. This ratio shall be determined by the number of categories of federal offices on the ballot and the number of categories of non-federal offices on the ballot, as described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
      <P>(ii) In calculating a ballot composition ratio, a state or local party committee shall count the federal offices of President, United States Senator, and United States Representative, if expected on the ballot in the next general election, as one federal office each. The committee shall count the non-federal offices of Governor, State Senator, and State Representative, if expected on the ballot in the next general election, as one non-federal office each. The committee shall count the total of all other partisan statewide executive candidates, if expected on the ballot in the next general election, as a maximum of two non-federal offices. State party committees shall also include in the ratio one additional non-federal office if any partisan local candidates are expected on the ballot in any regularly scheduled election during the two-year congressional election cycle. Local party committees shall also include in the ratio a maximum of two additional non-federal offices if any partisan local candidates are expected on the ballot in any regularly scheduled election during the two-year congressional election cycle. State and local party committees shall also include in the ratio one additional non-federal office.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Exception for states that do not hold federal and non-federal elections in the same year.</E> State and local party committees in states that do not hold federal and non-federal elections in the same year shall allocate the costs of generic voter drives according to the ballot composition method described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, based on a ratio calculated for that calendar year. These committees shall allocate their administrative expenses according to the ballot composition method described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, based on a ratio calculated for the two-year Congressional election cycle.</P>
      <P>(e) <E T="03">State and local party committees; method for allocating costs of exempt activities.</E> Each state or local party committee shall allocate its expenses for activities exempt from the definitions of <E T="03">contribution</E> and <E T="03">expenditure</E> under 11 CFR 100.7(b) (9), (15) or (17), and 100.8(b) (10), (16) or (18), when conducted in conjunction with non-federal election activities, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to the proportion of time or space devoted in a communication. Under this method, the committee shall allocate expenses of a particular communication based on the ratio of the portion of the communication devoted to federal candidates or elections as compared to the entire communication. In the case of a publication, this ratio shall be determined by the space devoted to federal candidates or elections as compared to <PRTPAGE P="110"/>the total space devoted to all federal and non-federal candidates or elections. In the case of a phone bank, the ratio shall be determined by the number of questions or statements devoted to federal candidates or elections as compared to the total number of questions or statements devoted to all federal and non-federal candidates or elections.</P>
      <P>(f) <E T="03">All party committees; method for allocating direct costs of fundraising.</E> (1) If federal and non-federal funds are collected by one committee through a joint activity, that committee shall allocate its direct costs of fundraising, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to the funds received method. Under this method, the committee shall allocate its fundraising costs based on the ratio of funds received into its federal account to its total receipts from each fundraising program or event. This ratio shall be estimated prior to each such program or event based upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its federal and non-federal revenue from that program or event, and shall be noted in the committee's report for the period in which the first disbursement for such program or event occurred, submitted pursuant 11 CFR 104.5. Any disbursements for fundraising costs made prior to the actual program or event shall be allocated according to this estimated ratio.</P>
      <P>(2) No later than the date 60 days after each fundraising program or event from which both federal and non-federal funds are collected, the committee shall adjust the allocation ratio for that program or event to reflect the actual ratio of funds received. If the non-federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall transfer funds from its federal to its non-federal account, as necessary, to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio. If the federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall make any transfers of funds from its non-federal to its federal account to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio within the 60-day time period established by this paragraph. The committee shall make note of any such adjustments and transfers in its report for any period in which a transfer was made, and shall also report the date of the fundraising program or event which serves as the basis for the transfer. In the case of a telemarketing or direct mail campaign, the “date” for purposes of this paragraph is the last day of the telemarketing campaign, or the day on which the final direct mail solicitations are mailed.</P>
      <P>(g) <E T="03">Payment of allocable expenses by committees with separate federal and non-federal accounts</E>—(1) <E T="03">Payment options.</E> Committees that have established separate federal and non-federal accounts under 11 CFR 102.5 (a)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(i) shall pay the expenses of joint federal and non-federal activities described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section according to either paragraph (g)(1) (i) or (ii), as follows:</P>
      <P>(i) <E T="03">Payment by federal account; transfers from non-federal account to federal account.</E> The committee shall pay the entire amount of an allocable expense from its federal account and shall transfer funds from its non-federal account to its federal account solely to cover the non-federal share of that allocable expense.</P>
      <P>(ii) <E T="03">Payment by separate allocation account; transfers from federal and non-federal accounts to allocation account.</E> (A) The committee shall establish a separate allocation account into which funds from its federal and non-federal accounts shall be deposited solely for the purpose of paying the allocable expenses of joint federal and non-federal activities. Once a committee has established a separate allocation account for this purpose, all allocable expenses shall be paid from that account for as long as the account is maintained.</P>
      <P>(B) The committee shall transfer funds from its federal and non-federal accounts to its allocation account in amounts proportionate to the federal or non-federal share of each allocable expense.</P>
      <P>(C) No funds contained in the allocation account may be transferred to any other account maintained by the committee.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Timing of transfers between accounts.</E> (i) Under either payment option described in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, the committee shall transfer funds from its non-federal account to its federal account or from its <PRTPAGE P="111"/>federal and non-federal accounts to its separate allocation account following determination of the final cost of each joint federal and non-federal activity, or in advance of such determination if advance payment is required by the vendor and if such payment is based on a reasonable estimate of the activity's final cost as determined by the committee and the vendor(s) involved.</P>
      <P>(ii) Funds transferred from a committee's non-federal account to its federal account or its allocation account are subject to the following requirements:</P>
      <P>(A) For each such transfer, the committee must itemize in its reports the allocable activities for which the transferred funds are intended to pay, as required by 11 CFR 104.10(b)(3); and</P>
      <P>(B) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, such funds may not be transferred more than 10 days before or more than 60 days after the payments for which they are designated are made.</P>
      <P>(iii) Any portion of a transfer from a committee's non-federal account to its federal account or its allocation account that does not meet the requirements of paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section shall be presumed to be a loan or contribution from the non-federal account to a federal account, in violation of the Act.</P>
      <P>(3) <E T="03">Reporting transfers of funds and allocated disbursements.</E> A political committee that transfers funds between accounts and pays allocable expenses according to this section shall report each such transfer and disbursement pursuant to 11 CFR 104.10(b).</P>

For purposes of this section, “nonconnected committee” includes any committee which conducts activities in connection with an election, but which is not a party committee, an authorized committee of any candidate for federal election, or a separate segregated fund.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Costs to be allocated</E>—(1) <E T="03">Separate segregated funds.</E> Separate segregated funds that make disbursements in connection with federal and non-federal elections shall allocate expenses for the following categories of activity:</P>

      <P>(ii) The direct costs of a fundraising program or event including disbursements for solicitation of funds and for planning and administration of actual fundraising events, where federal and non-federal funds are collected through such program or event, if such expenses are not paid by the separate segregated fund's connected organization; and</P>
      <P>(iii) Generic voter drives including voter identification, voter registration, and get-out-the-vote drives, or any other activities that urge the general public to register, vote or support candidates of a particular party or associated with a particular issue, without mentioning a specific candidate.</P>

      <P>(1) Under this method, expenses shall be allocated based on the ratio of federal expenditures to total federal and non-federal disbursements made by the committee during the two-year federal election cycle. This ratio shall be estimated and reported at the beginning of each federal election cycle, based upon the committee's federal and non-federal disbursements in a prior comparable federal election cycle or upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its disbursements for the coming two years. In calculating its federal expenditures, the committee shall include only amounts contributed to or otherwise spent on behalf of specific federal candidates.

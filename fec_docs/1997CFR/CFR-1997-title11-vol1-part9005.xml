      <SUBJECT>Certification of payments for candidates.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">Certification of payments for major party candidates.</E> Not later than 10 days after the Commission determines that the Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates of a major party have met all applicable conditions for eligibility to receive payments under 11 CFR 9003.1 and 9003.2, the Commission shall certify to the Secretary that payment in full of the amounts to which such candidates are entitled under 11 CFR part 9004 should be made pursuant to 11 CFR 9005.2.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Certification of pre-election payments for minor and new party candidates.</E> (1) Not later than 10 days after a minor or new party candidate has met all applicable conditions for eligibility to receive payments under 11 CFR 9003.1, 9003.2 and 9004.2, the Commission will make an initial determination of the amount, if any, to which the candidate is entitled. The Commission will base its determination on the percentage of votes received in the official vote count certified in each State. In notifying the candidate, the Commission will give the legal and factual reasons for its determination and advise the candidate of the evidence on which the determination is based.</P>
      <P>(2) The candidate may submit, within 15 days after the Commission's initial determination, written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that a redetermination is appropriate. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires.</P>
      <P>(3) The Commission will consider any written legal or factual materials timely submitted by the candidate in making its final determination. A final determination of certification by the Commission will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons for the Commission's action. This statement will explain the reasons underlying the Commission's determination and will summarize the results of any investigation on which the determination is based.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Certification of minor and new party candidates for post-election payments.</E> (1) Not later than 30 days after the general election, the Commission will determine whether a minor or new party candidate is eligible for post-election payments.</P>
      <P>(2) The Commission's determination of eligibility will be based on the following factors:</P>
      <P>(i) The candidate has received at least 5% or more of the total popular vote based on unofficial vote results in each State;</P>
      <P>(ii) The candidate has filed a preliminary statement of his or her net outstanding qualified campaign expenses pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.9(a); and</P>
      <P>(iii) The candidate has met all applicable conditions for eligibility under 11 CFR 9003.1 and 9003.2.</P>
      <P>(3) The Commission will notify the candidate of its initial determination of the amount, if any, to which the candidate is entitled, give the legal and factual reasons for its determination and advise the candidate of the evidence on which the determination is based. The Commission will also notify the candidate that it will deduct a percentage of the amount to which the candidate is entitled based on the unofficial vote results when the Commission certifies an amount for payment to the Secretary. This deduction will be based on the average percentage differential between the unofficial and official vote results for all candidates who received public funds in the preceding Presidential general election.</P>
      <P>(4) The candidate may submit within 15 days after the Commission's initial determination written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that a redetermination is appropriate. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires.</P>
      <P>(5) The Commission will consider any written legal or factual materials timely submitted by the candidate in making its final determination. A final determination of certification by the Commission will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons for the Commission's action. This statement will explain the reasons underlying the Commission's determination and will summarize the results of any investigation on which the determination is based.</P>

      <P>(d) All certifications made by the Commission pursuant to this section shall be final and conclusive, except to <PRTPAGE P="211"/>the extent that they are subject to examination and audit by the Commission under 11 CFR part 9007 and judicial review under 26 U.S.C. 9011.</P>

      <P>(a) Upon receipt of a certification from the Commission under 11 CFR 9005.1 for payment to the eligible Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates of a political party, the Secretary shall pay to such candidates out of the Fund the amount certified by the Commission. Amounts paid to a candidate shall be under the control of that candidate.</P>
      <P>(b)(1) If at the time of a certification from the Commission under 11 CFR 9005.1, the Secretary determines that the monies in the Fund are not, or may not be, sufficient to satisfy the full entitlements of the eligible candidates of all political parties, he or she shall withhold an amount which is determined to be necessary to assure that the eligible candidates of each political party will receive their pro rata share.</P>
      <P>(2) Amounts withheld under 11 CFR 9005.2(b)(1) shall be paid when the Secretary determines that there are sufficient monies in the Fund to pay such amounts, or pro rata portions thereof, to all eligible candidates from whom amounts have been withheld.</P>
      <P>(c) Payments received from the Fund by a major party candidate shall be deposited in a separate account maintained by his or her authorized committee, unless there is a deficiency in the Fund as provided under 11 CFR 9005.2(b)(1). In the case of a deficiency, the candidate may establish a separate account for payments from the Fund or may deposit such payments with contributions received pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.3(b).

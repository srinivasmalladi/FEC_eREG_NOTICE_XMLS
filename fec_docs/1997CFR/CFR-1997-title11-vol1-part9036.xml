      <SUBJECT>Threshold submission.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">Time for submission of threshold submission.</E> At any time after January 1 of the year immediately preceding the Presidential election year, the candidate may submit a threshold submission for matching fund payments in accordance with the format for such submissions set forth in 11 CFR 9036.1(b). The candidate may submit the threshold submission simultaneously with or subsequent to his or her submission of the candidate agreement and certifications required by 11 CFR 9033.1 and 9033.2.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Format for threshold submission.</E> (1) For each State in which the candidate certifies that he or she has met the requirements of the certifications in 11 CFR 9033.2(b), the candidate shall submit an alphabetical list of contributors showing:</P>
      <P>(i) Each contributor's full name and residential address;</P>
      <P>(ii) The occupation and name of employer for individuals whose aggregate contributions exceed $200 in the calendar year;</P>
      <P>(iii) The date of deposit of each contribution into the designated campaign depository;</P>
      <P>(iv) The full dollar amount of each contribution submitted for matching purposes;</P>
      <P>(v) The matchable portion of each contribution submitted for matching purposes;</P>
      <P>(vi) The aggregate amount of all matchable contributions from that contributor submitted for matching purposes;</P>
      <P>(vii) A notation indicating which contributions were received as a result of joint fundraising activities.</P>
      <P>(2) For each list of contributors generated directly or indirectly from computerized files or computerized records, the candidate shall submit computerized magnetic media, such as magnetic tapes or magnetic diskettes, containing the information required by 11 CFR 9036.1(b)(1) in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.12.</P>

      <P>(3) The candidate shall submit a full-size photocopy of each check or written instrument and of supporting documentation in accordance with 11 CFR 9034.2 for each contribution that the candidate submits to establish eligibility for matching funds. For purposes of the threshold submission, the photocopies shall be segregated alphabetically by contributor within each State, <PRTPAGE P="264"/>and shall be accompanied by and referenced to copies of the relevant deposit slips.</P>
      <P>(4) The candidate shall submit bank documentation, such as bank-validated deposit slips or unvalidated deposit slips accompanied by the relevant bank statements, which indicate that the contributions submitted were deposited into a designated campaign depository.</P>
      <P>(5) For each State in which the candidate certifies that he or she has met the requirements to establish eligibility, the candidate shall submit a listing, alphabetically by contributor, of all checks returned by the bank to date as unpaid (e.g., stop payments, non-sufficient funds) regardless of whether the contribution was submitted for matching. This listing shall be accompanied by a full-size photocopy of each unpaid check, and copies of the associated debit memo and bank statement.</P>
      <P>(6) For each State in which the candidate certifies that he or she has met the requirements to establish eligibility, the candidate shall submit a listing, in alphabetical order by contributor, of all contributions that were refunded to the contributor, regardless of whether the contributions were submitted for matching. For each refunded contribution, the listing shall state the contributor's full name and address, the deposit date and batch number, an indication of which matching fund submission the contribution was included in, if any, and the amount and date of the refund. The listing shall be accompanied by a full-sized photocopy of each refunded contributor check.</P>
      <P>(7) The candidate shall submit all contributions in accordance with the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order.</P>
      <P>(8) Contributions that are not submitted in compliance with this section shall not count toward the threshold amount.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Threshold certification by Commission.</E> (1) After the Commission has determined under 11 CFR 9033.4 that the candidate has satisfied the eligibility and certification requirements of 11 CFR 9033.1 and 9033.2, the Commission will notify the candidate in writing that the candidate is eligible to receive primary matching fund payments as provided in 11 CFR part 9034.</P>
      <P>(2) If the Commission makes a determination of a candidate's eligibility under 11 CFR 9036.1(a) in a Presidential election year, the Commission shall certify to the Secretary, within 10 calendar days after the Commission has made its determination, the amount to which the candidate is entitled.</P>
      <P>(3) If the Commission makes a determination of a candidate's eligibility under 11 CFR 9036.1(a) in the year preceding the Presidential election year, the Commission will notify the candidate that he or she is eligible to receive matching fund payments; however, the Commission's determination will not result in a payment of funds to the candidate until after January 1 of the Presidential election year.</P>

      <SECTNO>§ 9036.2</SECTNO>
      <SUBJECT>Additional submissions for matching fund payments.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">Time for submission of additional submissions.</E> The candidate may submit additional submissions for payments to the Commission on dates to be determined and published by the Commission. On the last two submission dates in the year prior to the election year and on each submission date after the beginning of the matching payment period, the candidate may not make more than one additional submission, and either one resubmission under 11 CFR 9036.5 or one corrected submission under 11 CFR 9036.2(c) or (d)(2), as appropriate.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Format for additional submissions.</E> The candidate may obtain additional matching fund payments subsequent to the Commission's threshold certification and payment of primary matching funds to the candidate by filing an additional submission for payment. All additional submissions for payments filed by the candidate shall be made in accordance with the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order.</P>

      <P>(1) The first submission for matching funds following the candidate's threshold submission shall contain all the matchable contributions included in the threshold submission and any additional contributions to be submitted for matching in that submission. This <PRTPAGE P="265"/>submission shall contain all the information required for the threshold submission except that:</P>
      <P>(i) The candidate is not required to resubmit the candidate agreement and certifications of 11 CFR 9033.1 and 9033.2;</P>
      <P>(ii) The candidate is required to submit an alphabetical list of contributors (either solely in magnetic media from or in both printed and magnetic media forms), but not segregated by State as required in the threshold submission;</P>
      <P>(iii) The candidate is required to submit a listing, alphabetical by contributor, of all checks returned unpaid, but not segregated by State as required in the threshold submission;</P>
      <P>(iv) The candidate is required to submit a listing, in alphabetical order by contributor, of all contributions refunded to the contributor but not segregated by State as required in the threshold submission.</P>
      <P>(v) The occupation and employer's name need not be disclosed on the contributor list for individuals whose aggregate contributions exceed $200 in the calendar year, but such information is subject to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of 2 U.S.C. 432(c)(3), 434(b)(3)(A) and 11 CFR 102.9(a)(2), 104.3(a)(4)(i); and</P>
      <P>(vi) The photocopies of each check or written instrument and of supporting documentation shall either be alphabetized and referenced to copies of the relevant deposit slip, but not segregated by State as required in the threshold submission; or such photocopies may be batched in deposits of 50 contributions or less and cross-referenced by deposit number and sequence number within each deposit on the contributor list. In lieu of submitting photocopies, the candidate may submit digital images of checks, written instruments and deposit slips as specified in the Computerized Magnetic Media Requirements. The candidate shall provide the computer equipment and software needed to retrieve and read the digital images, if necessary, at no cost to the Commission, and shall include digital images of every contribution received and imaged on or after the date of the previous matching fund request. Contributions and other documentation not imaged shall be submitted in photocopy form.</P>
      <P>(2) Following the first submission under 11 CFR 9036.2(b)(1), candidates may request additional matching funds on dates prescribed by the Commission by making a full submission as required under 11 CFR 9036.2(b)(1). The amount requested for matching may include contributions received up to the last business day preceding the date of the request.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional submissions submitted in non-Presidential election year.</E> The candidate may submit additional contributions for review during the year preceding the presidential election year; however, the amount of each submission made during this period must exceed $50,000. Additional submissions filed by a candidate in a non-Presidential election year will not result in payment of matching funds to the candidate until after January 1 of the Presidential election year. If the projected dollar value of the nonmatchable contributions exceeds 15% of the amount requested, the procedures described in 11 CFR 9036.2(d)(2) shall apply, unless the submission was made on the last submission date in December of the year before the Presidential election year.</P>
      <P>(d) <E T="03">Certification of additional payments by Commission.</E> (1) When a candidate who is eligible under 11 CFR 9033.4 submits an additional submission for payment in the Presidential election year, and before the candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will review the additional submission and will certify to the Secretary at least once a month on dates to be determined and published by the Commission, an amount to which the candidate is entitled in accordance with 11 CFR 9034.1(b). See 11 CFR 9036.4 for Commission procedures for certification of additional payments.</P>

      <P>(2) After a candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will review each additional submission and resubmission, and will certify to the Secretary, at least once a month on dates to be determined and published by the Commission, an amount to which the ineligible candidate is entitled in accordance with 11 CFR 9034.1(b), unless the projected dollar value of the nonmatchable contributions contained in <PRTPAGE P="266"/>the submission or resubmission exceeds 15% of the amount requested. In the latter case, the Commission will return the additional submission or resubmission to the candidate and request that it be corrected, unless the resubmission was made on the last date for resubmissions in September of the year following the Presidential election year. Corrected submissions and resubmissions will be reviewed by the Commission in accordance with 11 CFR 9036.4 and 9036.5. Submissions and resubmissions will not be considered to be corrected unless the projected dollar value of nonmatchable contributions has been reduced to no more than 15% of the amount requested.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Submission errors and insufficient documentation.</SUBJECT>
      <P>Contributions which are otherwise matchable may be rejected for matching purposes because of submission errors or insufficient supporting documentation. Contributions, other than those defined in 11 CFR 9034.3 or in the form of money orders, cashier's checks, or similar negotiable instruments, may become matchable if there is a proper resubmission in accordance with 11 CFR 9036.5 and 9036.6. Insufficient documentation or submission errors include but are not limited to:</P>
      <P>(a) Discrepancies in the written instrument, such as:</P>
      <P>(1) Instruments drawn on other than personal accounts of contributors and not signed by the contributing individual;</P>
      <P>(2) Signature discrepancies; and</P>
      <P>(3) Lack of the contributor's signature, the amount or date of the contribution, or the listing of the committee or candidate as payee.</P>
      <P>(b) Discrepancies between listed contributions and the written instrument or supporting documentation, such as:</P>
      <P>(1) The listed amount requested for matching exceeds the amount contained on the written instrument;</P>
      <P>(2) A written instrument has not been submitted to support a listed contribution;</P>
      <P>(3) The submitted written instrument cannot be associated either by accountholder identification or signature with the listed contributor; or</P>
      <P>(4) A discrepancy between the listed contribution and the supporting bank documentation or the bank documentation is omitted.</P>
      <P>(c) Discrepancies within or between contributor lists submitted, such as:</P>
      <P>(1) The address of the contributor is omitted or incomplete or the contributor's name is alphabetized incorrectly, or more than one contributor is listed per item;</P>
      <P>(2) A discrepancy in aggregation within or between submissions which results in a request that more than $250 be matched for that contributor, or a listing of a contributor more than once within the same submission; or</P>
      <P>(3) A written instrument has been previously submitted and matched in full or is listed twice in the same submission.</P>
      <P>(d) The omission of information, supporting statements, or documentation required by 11 CFR 9034.2.</P>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
      <SECTNO>§ 9036.4</SECTNO>
      <SUBJECT>Commission review of submissions.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">Non-acceptance of submission for review of matchability.</E> (1) The Commission will make an initial review of each submission made under 11 CFR part 9036 to determine if it substantially meets the format requirements of 11 CFR 9036.1(b) and 9036.2(b) and the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order. If the Commission determines that a submission does not substantially meet these requirements, it will not review the matchability of the contributions contained therein.</P>
      <P>(2) For submissions made in the year before the Presidential election year (other than submissions made on the last submission date in that year), and submissions made after the candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will stop reviewing the submission once the projected dollar value of nonmatchable contributions exceeds 15% of the amount requested, as provided in 11 CFR 9036.2 (c) or (d), as applicable.</P>

      <P>(3) Under either paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the Commission will return the submission to the candidate and request that it be corrected <PRTPAGE P="267"/>in accordance with the applicable requirements. If the candidate makes a corrected submission within 5 business days after the Commission's return of the original, the Commission will review the corrected submission prior to the next regularly scheduled submission date, and will certify to the Secretary the amount to which the candidate is entitled on the regularly scheduled certification date for the original submission. Corrected submissions made after this five-day period will be reviewed subsequent to the next regularly scheduled submission date, and the Commission will certify to the Secretary the amount to which the candidate is entitled on the next regularly scheduled certification date. Each corrected submission shall only contain contributions previously submitted for matching in the returned submission and no new or additional contributions.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptance of submission for review of matchability.</E> If the Commission determines that a submission made under 11 CFR part 9036 satisfies the requirements of 11 CFR 9036.1(b) and 9036.2 (b), (c) and (d), and the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order, it will review the matchability of the contributions contained therein. The Commission, in conducting its review, may utilize statistical sampling techniques. Based on the results of its review, the Commission may calculate a matchable amount for the submission which is less than the amount requested by the candidate. If the Commission certifies for payment to the Secretary an amount that is less than the amount requested by the candidate in a particular submission, or reduces the amount of a subsequent certification to the Secretary by adjusting a previous certification made under 11 CFR 9036.2(c)(1), the Commission will notify the candidate in writing of the following:</P>
      <P>(1) The amount of the difference between the amount requested and the amount to be certified by the Commission;</P>
      <P>(2) The amount of each contribution and the corresponding contributor's name for each contribution that the Commission has rejected as nonmatchable and the reason that it is not matchable; or if statistical sampling is used, the estimated amount of contributions by type and the reason for rejection;</P>
      <P>(3) The amount of contributions that have been determined to be matchable and that the Commission will certify to the Secretary for payment; and</P>
      <P>(4) A statement that the candidate may supply the Commission with additional documentation or other information in the resubmission of any rejected contribution under 11 CFR 9036.5 in order to show that a rejected contribution is matchable under 11 CFR 9034.2.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Adjustment of amount to be certified by Commission.</E> (1) The candidate shall notify the Commission as soon as possible if the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee(s) has knowledge that a contribution submitted for matching does not qualify under 11 CFR 9034.2 as a matchable contribution, such as a check returned to the committee for insufficient funds or a contribution that has been refunded, so that the Commission may properly adjust the amount to be certified for payment.</P>
      <P>(2) After the candidate's date of ineligibility, if the candidate does not receive the entire amount of matching funds on a regularly scheduled payment date due to a shortfall in the matching payment account, prior to each subsequent payment date on which the candidate receives payments from any previous certification, the Commission may revise the amount previously certified for payment pursuant to 11 CFR 9034.5(f). The Commission will promptly notify the Secretary and the candidate of any revision to the amount certified.</P>
      <P>(d) <E T="03">Commission audit of submissions.</E> The Commission may determine, for the reasons stated in 11 CFR part 9039, that an audit and examination of contributions submitted for matching payment is warranted. The audit and examination shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures of 11 CFR part 9039.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Resubmissions.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">Alternative resubmission methods.</E> Upon receipt of the Commission's notice of the results of the submission review pursuant to 11 CFR 9036.4(b), or of an inquiry pursuant to 11 CFR 9039.3 that results in a downward adjustment to the amount of certified matching funds, a candidate may choose to:</P>
      <P>(1) Resubmit the entire submission; or</P>
      <P>(2) Make a written request for the identification of the specific contributions that were rejected for matching, and resubmit those specific contributions.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Time for presentation of resubmissions.</E> If the candidate chooses to resubmit any contributions under 11 CFR 9036.5(a), the contributions shall be resubmitted on dates to be determined and published by the Commission. The candidate may not make any resubmissions later than the first Tuesday in September of the year following the Presidential election year.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Format for resubmissions.</E> All resubmissions filed by the candidate shall be made in accordance with the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order. In making a presentation of resubmitted contributions, the candidate shall follow the format requirements as specified in 11 CFR 9036.2(b)(1), except that:</P>
      <P>(1) The candidate need not provide photocopies of written instruments, supporting documentation and bank documentation unless it is necessary to supplement the original documentation.</P>
      <P>(2) Each resubmitted contribution shall be referenced to the submission in which it was first presented.</P>
      <P>(3) Each list of resubmitted contributions shall reflect the aggregate amount of contributions submitted for matching from each contributor as of the date of the original submission.</P>
      <P>(4) Each list of resubmitted contributions shall reflect the aggregate amount of contributions submitted for matching from each contributor as of the date of the resubmission.</P>
      <P>(5) Each list of resubmitted contributions shall only contain contributions previously submitted for matching and no new or additional contributions.</P>
      <P>(6) Each resubmission shall be accompanied by a statement that the candidate has corrected his or her contributor records (including the data base for those candidates maintaining their contributor list on computer).</P>
      <P>(d) <E T="03">Certification of resubmitted contributions.</E> Contributions that the Commission determines to be matchable will be certified to the Secretary at least once a month on dates to be determined and published by the Commission. If the candidate chooses to request the specific contributions rejected for matching pursuant to 11 CFR 9036.5(a)(2), the amount certified shall equal only the matchable amount of the particular contribution that meets the standards on resubmission, rather than the amount projected as being nonmatchable based on that contribution due to the sampling techniques used in reviewing the original submission.</P>
      <P>(e) <E T="03">Initial determinations.</E> If the candidate resubmits a contribution for matching and the Commission determines that the rejected contribution is still non-matchable, the Commission will notify the candidate in writing of its determination. The Commission will advise the candidate of the legal and factual reasons for its determination and of the evidence on which that determination is based. The candidate may submit written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that the contribution is matchable within 30 calendar days after service of the Commission's notice. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires.</P>
      <P>(f) <E T="03">Final determinations.</E> The Commission will consider any written legal or factual materials timely submitted by the candidate in making its final determination. A final determination by the Commission that a contribution is not matchable will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons for the Commission's action. This statement will explain the reasons underlying the Commission's determination and will summarize the results of any investigation upon which the determination is based.</P>

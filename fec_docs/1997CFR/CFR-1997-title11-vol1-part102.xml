      <SUBJECT>Administrative termination (2 U.S.C. 433(d)(2)).</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) The Commission, on its own initiative or upon the request of the political committee itself, may administratively terminate a political committee's reporting obligation on the basis of the following factors:</P>
      <P>(1) The committee's aggregate reported financial activity in one year is less than $5000;</P>
      <P>(2) The committee's reports disclose no receipt of contributions for the previous year;</P>
      <P>(3) The committee's last report disclosed minimal expenditures;</P>
      <P>(4) The committee's primary purpose for filing its reports has been to disclose outstanding debts and obligations;</P>
      <P>(5) The committee has failed to file reports for the previous year;</P>
      <P>(6) The committee's last report disclosed that the committee's outstanding debts and obligations do not appear to present a possible violation of the prohibitions and limitations of 11 CFR parts 110 and 114;</P>
      <P>(7) The committee's last report disclosed that the Committee does not have substantial outstanding accounts receivable;</P>
      <P>(8) The committee's outstanding debts and obligations exceed the total of the committee's reported cash on hand balance.</P>
      <P>(b) The Commission shall send a notification to the committee treasurer of its intent to administratively terminate that committee and may request the treasurer to submit information with regard to the factors set forth at 11 CFR 102.4(a). The treasurer shall respond, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the Commission's notice or request and if the committee objects to such termination, the committee's response shall so state.</P>
      <P>(c) The Commission shall administratively terminate a committee if such committee fails to object to the Commission's action under 11 CFR 102.4(b) and the Commission determines that either:</P>
      <P>(1) The committee has complied with the debt settlement procedures set forth at 11 CFR part 116.</P>
      <P>(2) The Commission has approved the forgiveness of any loan(s) owed the committee which would have otherwise been considered a contribution under the Act in violation of 11 CFR part 110;</P>
      <P>(3) It does not appear from evidence available that a contribution in violation of 11 CFR parts 110 and 114 will result.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Organizations financing political activity in connection with Federal and non-Federal elections, other than through transfers and joint fundraisers.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) Organizations that are political committees under the Act</P>
      <P>(1) Each organization, including a party committee, which finances political activity in connection with both federal and non-federal elections and which qualifies as a political committee under 11 CFR 100.5 shall either:</P>
      <P>(i) Establish a separate federal account in a depository in accordance with 11 CFR part 103. Such account shall be treated as a separate federal political committee which shall comply with the requirements of the Act including the registration and reporting requirements of 11 CFR parts 102 and 104. Only funds subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the Act shall be deposited in such separate federal account. All disbursements, contributions, expenditures and transfers by the committee in connection with any federal election shall be made from its federal account. No transfers may be made to such federal account from any other account(s) maintained by such organization for the purpose of financing activity in connection with non-federal elections, except as provided in 11 CFR 106.5(g) and 106.6(e). Administrative expenses shall be allocated pursuant to 11 CFR part 106 between such federal account and any other account maintained by such committee for the purpose of financing activity in connection with non-federal elections; or</P>

      <P>(ii) Establish a political committee which shall receive only contributions subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the Act, regardless of whether such contributions are for use in connection with federal or non-federal <PRTPAGE P="71"/>elections. Such organization shall register as a political committee and comply with the requirements of the Act.</P>
      <P>(2) Only contributions meeting the conditions set forth at subsections (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section may be deposited in a federal account established under 11 CFR 102.5(a)(1)(i) or may be received by a political committee established under 11 CFR 102.5(a)(1)(ii).</P>
      <P>(i) Contributions designated for the federal account;</P>
      <P>(ii) Contributions that result from a solicitation which expressly states that the contribution will be used in connection with a federal election; and</P>
      <P>(iii) Contributions from contributors who are informed that all contributions are subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the Act.</P>
      <P>(3) Any party committee solicitation that makes reference to a federal candidate or a federal election shall be presumed to be for the purpose of influencing a federal election, and contributions resulting from that solicitation shall be subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the Act. This presumption may be rebutted by demonstrating to the Commission that the funds were solicited with express notice that they would not be used for federal election purposes.</P>
      <P>(b) Organizations that are not political committees under the Act</P>
      <P>(1) Any organization that makes contributions or expenditures but does not qualify as a political committee under 11 CFR 100.5 and any State or local party organization that makes contributions, expenditures and exempted payments under 11 CFR 100.7(b)(9), (15) and (17) and 100.8(b)(10), (16) and (18) shall either:</P>
      <P>(i) Establish a separate account to which only funds subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the Act shall be deposited and from which contributions, expenditures and exempted payments shall be made. Such organization shall keep records of deposits to and disbursements from such account and, upon request, shall make such records available for examination by the Commission.</P>
      <P>(ii) Demonstrate through a reasonable accounting method that whenever such organization makes a contribution, expenditure or exempted payment, that organization has received sufficient funds subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the Act to make such contribution, expenditure or payment. Such organization shall keep records of amounts received or expended under this subsection and, upon request, shall make such records available for examination by the Commission.</P>

      <P>(a) <E T="03">Transfers of funds; registration and reporting required—</E>(1) <E T="03">Who may make transfers under this section.</E> (i) Transfers of funds may be made without limit on amount between affiliated committees whether or not they are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5.</P>
      <P>(ii) Transfers of funds may be made without limit on amount between or among a national party committee, a State party committee and/or any subordinate party committee whether or not they are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5 and whether or not such committees are affiliated.</P>
      <P>(iii) Transfers of joint fundraising proceeds may be made without limit on amount between organizations or committees participating in the joint fundraising activity provided that no participating committee or organization governed by 11 CFR 102.17 received more than its allocated share of the funds raised.</P>
      <P>(iv) Transfers under paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iii) shall be made only from funds which are permissible under the Act. See 11 CFR parts 110, 114 and 115.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">When registration and reporting required.</E> Except as provided in 11 CFR 102.6(b), organizations or committees making transfers under 11 CFR 102.6(a)(1) shall count such transfers against the reporting thresholds of the Act for determining whether an organization or committee is a political committee under 11 CFR 100.5.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Fundraising by collecting agents; No reporting required—</E>(1) <E T="03">Definition of collecting agent.</E> A collecting agent is an organization or committee that collects and transmits contributions to <PRTPAGE P="72"/>one or more separate segregated funds to which the collecting agent is related. A collecting agent may be either:</P>
      <P>(i) A committee, whether or not it is a political committee as defined in 11 CFR 100.5, affiliated with the separate segregated fund under 11 CFR 110.3; or</P>
      <P>(ii) The connected organization of the separate segregated fund as defined in 11 CFR 100.6; or</P>
      <P>(iii) A parent, subsidiary, branch, division, department, or local unit of the connected organization of the separate segregated fund; or</P>

      <P>(iv) A local, national or international union collecting contributions on behalf of the separate segregated fund of any federation with which the local, national or international union is affiliated. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 114.1(e).</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Collecting agent not required to report.</E> A collecting agent that is an unregistered organization and that follows the procedures of 11 CFR 102.6(c) is not required to register and report as a political committee under 11 CFR parts 102 and 104, provided that the organization does not engage in other activities such as making contributions or expenditures for the purpose of influencing federal elections.</P>
      <P>(3) <E T="03">Who is not a collecting agent—</E>(i) <E T="03">Commercial fundraising firm.</E> A separate segregated fund or a collecting agent may hire a commercial fundraising firm to assist in fundraising; however, the commercial fundraising firm shall not be considered as a collecting agent for the purpose of this section. Rather, the commercial fundraising firm shall be considered to be the agent of the separate segregated fund or collecting agent.</P>
      <P>(ii) <E T="03">Individuals.</E> An individual who collects contributions for a separate segregated fund shall not be considered a collecting agent for the purpose of this section. Individuals who collect contributions are subject to the requirements of 11 CFR 102.8 and the provisions of 11 CFR part 110.</P>
      <P>(4) <E T="03">Separate segregated fund may collect contributions.</E>
        <E T="11">Nothing in this section shall preclude a separate segregated fund from soliciting and collecting contributions on its own behalf.</E>
      </P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures for collecting agents—</E>
        <E T="11">(1)</E>
        <E T="03">Separate segregated fund responsible for acts of collecting agent.</E> The separate segregated fund shall be responsible for ensuring that the recordkeeping, reporting and transmittal requirements of this section are met.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Solicitation for contributions.</E>
        <E T="11">A collecting agent may include a solicitation for voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund in a bill for membership dues or other payments such as conference registration fees or a solicitation for contributions to the collecting agent. The collecting agent may only solicit contributions from those persons permitted to be solicited under 11 CFR part 114. The solicitation for contributions must meet all of the requirements for proper solicitations under 11 CFR 114.5.</E>
      </P>
      <P>(i) The collecting agent may pay any or all of the costs incurred in soliciting and transmitting contributions to the separate segregated fund.</P>
      <P>(ii) If the separate segregated fund pays any solicitation or other administrative expense from its own account, which expense could be paid for as an administrative expense by the collecting agent, the collecting agent may reimburse the separate segregated fund no later than 30 calendar days after the expense was paid by the separate segregated fund.</P>
      <P>(3) <E T="03">Checks combining contributions with other payments.</E>
        <E T="11">A contributor may write a check that represents both a contribution and payment of dues or other fees. The check must be drawn on the contributor's personal checking account or on a non-repayable corporate drawing account of the individual contributor. Under a payroll deduction plan, an employer may write a check on behalf of its employees to a union or its agent, which check represents a combined payment of voluntary contributions to the union's separate segregated fund and union dues or other employee deductions.</E>
      </P>
      <P>(4) <E T="03">Transmittal of contributions.</E>
        <E T="11">The full amount of each contribution collected by a collecting agent on behalf of a separate segregated fund shall be transmitted to that fund within 10 or 30 days as required by 11 CFR 102.8.</E>
      </P>

      <P>(i) Checks made payable to the separate segregated fund shall be transmitted by the collecting agent directly to the separate segregated fund in accordance with 11 CFR 102.8.<PRTPAGE P="73"/>
      </P>
      <P>(ii) To transfer all other contributions, a collecting agent shall either:</P>
      <P>(A) Establish a transmittal account to be used solely for the deposit and transmittal of funds collected on behalf of the separate segregated fund. Funds deposited into this account are subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the Act. If any expenditure is made from the account, other than a transfer of funds to an affiliated committee, the account shall be considered a depository of the recipient committee and all activity of that account shall be reported; or</P>
      <P>(B) Deposit the contributions collected into the collecting agent's treasury account. The collecting agent shall keep separate records of all receipts and deposits that represent contributions to the separate segregated fund and, in the case of cash contributions, the collecting agent shall make separate deposits of such funds; or</P>
      <P>(C) Deposit the contributions collected into an account otherwise established solely for State or local election activity. The collecting agent shall keep separate records of all receipts and deposits that represent contributions to the separate segregated fund; or</P>
      <P>(D) In the case of cash contributions, transmit the contributions to the separate segregated fund in the form of money orders or cashier's checks.</P>
      <P>(5) <E T="03">Contributor information.</E> The collecting agent shall comply with the requirements of 11 CFR 102.8 regarding transmittal of contributions and contributor information to the separate segregated fund, except that if contributions of $50 or less are received at a mass collection, a record shall be kept of the date, the total amount collected, and the name of the function at which the collection was made.</P>
      <P>(6) <E T="03">Retention of records.</E> The collecting agent shall retain all records of contribution deposits and transmittals under this section for a period of three years and shall make these records available to the Commission on request. The separate segregated fund shall keep a record of all transmittals of contributions received from collecting agents under this section, and shall retain these records for a period of three years.</P>
      <P>(7) <E T="03">Reporting of funds received through collecting agents.</E> A separate segregated fund receiving contributions collected by a collecting agent shall report the full amount of each contribution received as a contribution from the original contributor to the extent required by 11 CFR 104.3(a).</P>

      <SUBJECT>Joint fundraising by committees other than separate segregated funds.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1)(i) Political committees may engage in joint fundraising with other political committees or with unregistered committees or organizations. The participants in a joint fundraising effort under this section shall either establish a separate committee or select a participating committee, to act as fundraising representative for all participants. The fundraising representative shall be a reporting political committee and an authorized committee of each candidate for federal office participating in the joint fundraising activity. If the participants establish a separate committee to act as the fundraising representative, the separate committee shall not be a participant in any other joint fundraising effort, but the separate committee may conduct more than one joint fundraising effort for the participants.</P>
      <P>(ii) The participants may hire a commercial fundraising firm or other agent to assist in conducting the joint fundraising activity. In that case, however, the fundraising representative shall still be responsible for ensuring that the recordkeeping and reporting requirements set forth in this section are met.</P>
      <P>(2) The procedures in 11 CFR 102.17(c) will govern all joint fundraising activity conducted under this section. The participants in joint fundraising activity may include political party committees (whether or not they are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5), candidate committees, multicandidate committees, and unregistered organizations which do not qualify as collecting agents under 11 CFR 102.6(b).</P>
      <P>(3) A fundraising representative conducting joint fundraising under this section is distinguished from an unregistered organization acting as a collecting agent under 11 CFR 102.6(b). If a separate segregated fund or an unregistered organization qualifies and acts as a collecting agent under 11 CFR 102.6(b), the provisions of 11 CFR 102.17 will not apply to that fundraising activity.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Fundraising representatives—</E>(1) <E T="03">Separate fundraising committee as fundraising representative.</E> Participating committees may establish a separate political committee to act as fundraising representative for all participants. This separate committee shall be a reporting political committee and shall collect contributions, pay fundraising costs from gross proceeds and from funds advanced by participants, and disburse net proceeds to each participant.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Participating committee as fundraising representative.</E> All participating committees may select one participant to act as fundraising representative for all participants. The fundraising representative must be a political committee as defined in 11 CFR 100.5. The fundraising representative and any other participating committees may collect contributions; however, all contributions received by other participants shall be forwarded to the fundraising representative as required by 11 CFR 102.8. The fundraising representative shall pay fundraising costs from gross proceeds and from funds advanced by participants and shall disburse net proceeds to each participant.<PRTPAGE P="78"/>
      </P>
      <P>(3) <E T="03">Funds advanced for fundraising costs.</E> (i) Except as provided in 11 CFR 102.17(b) (3)(ii) and (iii), the amount of funds advanced by each participant for fundraising costs shall be in proportion to the allocation formula agreed upon under 11 CFR 102.17 (c)(1).</P>

      <P>(ii) A participant may advance more than its proportionate share of the fundraising costs, however, the amount advanced which is in excess of the participant's proportionate share shall not exceed the amount that participant could legally contribute to the remaining participants. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 102.12(c)(2) and part 110.</P>
      <P>(iii) If all the participants are affiliated under 11 CFR 110.3 or if the participants are all party committees of the same political party, there is no limit on the amount a participant may advance for fundraising costs on behalf of the other participants.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Joint fundraising procedures.</E> The requirements of 11 CFR 102.17(c)(1) through (8) shall govern joint fundraising activity conducted under this section.</P>
      <P>(1) <E T="03">Written agreement.</E> The participants in a joint fundraising activity shall enter into a written agreement, whether or not all participants are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5. The written agreement shall identify the fundraising representative and shall state a formula for the allocation of fundraising proceeds. The formula shall be stated as the amount or percentage of each contribution received to be allocated to each participant. The fundraising representative shall retain the written agreement for a period of three years and shall make it available to the Commission on request.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Fundraising notice.</E> In addition to any notice required under 11 CFR 110.11, a joint fundraising notice shall be included with every solicitation for contributions.</P>
      <P>(i) This notice shall include the following information:</P>
      <P>(A) The names of all committees participating in the joint fundraising activity whether or not such committees are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5; and</P>
      <P>(B) The allocation formula to be used for distributing joint fundraising proceeds; and</P>
      <P>(C) A statement informing contributors that, notwithstanding the stated allocation formula, they may designate their contributions for a particular participant or participants; and</P>
      <P>(D) A statement informing contributors that the allocation formula may change if a contributor makes a contribution which would exceed the amount that contributor may give to any participant.</P>
      <P>(ii) In the following situations, the notice shall include the following additional information:</P>
      <P>(A) If one or more participants engage in the joint fundraising activity solely to satisfy outstanding debts, a statement informing contributors that the allocation formula may change if a participant receives sufficient funds to pay its outstanding debts; and</P>
      <P>(B) If one or more participants can lawfully accept contributions that are prohibited under the Act, a statement informing contributors that contributions from prohibited sources will be distributed only to those participants that can accept them.</P>
      <P>(3) <E T="03">Separate depository account.</E> (i) The participants or the fundraising representative shall establish a separate depository account to be used solely for the receipt and disbursement of the joint fundraising proceeds. All contributions deposited into the separate depository account must be permissible under the Act. Each political committee shall amend its Statement of Organization to reflect the account as an additional depository. If one or more participants can lawfully accept contributions that are prohibited under the Act, the participants may either establish a second depository account for contributions received from prohibited sources or they may forward such contributions directly to the nonfederal participants.</P>
      <P>(ii) The fundraising representative shall deposit all joint fundraising proceeds in the separate depository account within ten days of receipt as required by 11 CFR 103.3. The fundraising representative may delay distribution of the fundraising proceeds to the participants until all contributions are received and all expenses are paid.</P>

      <P>(iii) For contribution reporting and limitation purposes, the date of receipt <PRTPAGE P="79"/>of a contribution by a participating political committee is the date that the contribution is received by the fundraising representative. The fundraising representative shall report contributions in the reporting period in which they are received. Participating political committees shall report joint fundraising proceeds in accordance with 11 CFR 102.17(c)(8) when such funds are received from the fundraising representative.</P>
      <P>(4) <E T="03">Recordkeeping requirements.</E> (i) The fundraising representative and participating committees shall screen all contributions received to insure that the prohibitions and limitations of 11 CFR parts 110 and 114 are observed. Participating political committees shall make their contributor records available to the fundraising representative to enable the fundraising representative to carry out its duty to screen contributions.</P>
      <P>(ii) The fundraising representative shall collect and retain contributor information with regard to gross proceeds as required under 11 CFR 102.8 and shall also forward such information to participating political committees. The fundraising representative shall also keep a record of the total amount of contributions received from prohibited sources, if any, and of all transfers of prohibited contributions to participants that can accept them.</P>
      <P>(iii) The fundraising representative shall retain the records required under 11 CFR 102.9 regarding fundraising disbursements for a period of three years. Commercial fundraising firms or agents shall forward such information to the fundraising representative.</P>
      <P>(5) <E T="03">Contribution limitations.</E> Except to the extent that the contributor has previously contributed to any of the participants, a contributor may make a contribution to the joint fundraising effort which contribution represents the total amount that the contributor could contribute to all of the participants under the applicable limits of 11 CFR 110.1 and 110.2.</P>
      <P>(6) <E T="03">Allocation of gross proceeds</E>. (i) The fundraising representative shall allocate proceeds according to the formula stated in the fundraising agreement. If distribution according to the allocation formula extinguishes the debts of one or more participants and results in a surplus for those participants or if distribution under the formula results in a violation of the contribution limits of 11 CFR 110.1(a), the fundraising representative may reallocate the exesss funds. Reallocation shall be based upon the remaining participants’ proportionate shares under the allocation formula. If reallocation results in a violation of a contributor's limit under 11 CFR 110.1, the fundraising representative shall return to the contributor the amount of the contribution that exceeds the limit.</P>
      <P>(ii) Designated contributions which exceed the contributor's limit to the designated participant under 11 CFR part 110 may not be reallocated by the fundraising representative absent the prior written permission of the contributor.</P>
      <P>(iii) If any participants can lawfully accept contributions from sources prohibited under the Act, any such contributions that are received are not required to be distributed according to the allocation formula.</P>
      <P>(7) <E T="03">Allocation of expenses and distribution of net proceeds</E>. (i) If participating committees are not affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity and are not committees of the same political party;</P>
      <P>(A) After gross contributions are allocated among the participants under 11 CFR 102.17(c)(6), the fundraising representative shall calculate each participant's share of expenses based on the percentage of the total receipts each participant had been allocated. If contributions from sources prohibited under the Act have been received and distributed under 11 CFR 102.17(c)(6)(iii), those contributions need not be included in the total receipts for the purpose of allocating expenses under this section. To calculate each participant's net proceeds, the fundraising representative shall subtract the participant's share of expenses from the amount that participant has been allocated from gross proceeds.</P>

      <P>(B) A participant may only pay expenses on behalf of another participant subject to the contribution limits of 11 CFR part 110.<PRTPAGE P="80"/>
      </P>
      <P>(C) The expenses from a series of fundraising events or activities shall be allocated among the participants on a per-event basis regardless of whether the participants change or remain the same throughout the series.</P>
      <P>(ii) If participating committees are affilated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity or if participants are party committees of the same political party, expenses need not be allocated among those participants. Payment of such expenses by an unregistered committee or organization on behalf of an affiliated political committee may cause the unregistered organization to become a political committee.</P>
      <P>(iii) Payment of expenses may be made from gross proceeds by the fundraising representative.</P>
      <P>(8) <E T="03">Reporting of receipts and disbursements—</E>(i) <E T="03">Reporting receipts</E>. (A) The fundraising representative shall report all funds received in the reporting period in which they are received. The fundraising representative shall report the total amount of contributions received from prohibited sources during the reporting period, if any, as a memo entry. Each Schedule A filed by the fundraising representative under this section shall clearly indicate that the contributions reported on that schedule represent joint fundraising proceeds.</P>
      <P>(B) After distribution of net proceeds, each participating political committee shall report its share of net proceeds received as a transfer-in from the fundraising representative. Each participating political committee shall also file a memo Schedule A itemizing its share of gross receipts as contributions from original contributors to the extent required under 11 CFR 104.3(a).</P>
      <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reporting disbursements.</E> The fundraising representative shall report all disbursements in the reporting period in which they are made.</P>

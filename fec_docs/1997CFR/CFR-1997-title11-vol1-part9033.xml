      <SUBJECT>Candidate and committee certifications; threshold submission.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) A candidate seeking to become eligible to receive Presidential primary matching fund payments shall make the certifications set forth in 11 CFR 9033.2(b) to the Commission in a written statement signed by the candidate. The candidate may submit the letter containing the required certifications at any time after January 1 of the year immediately preceding the Presidential election year.</P>

      <P>(2) The Commission will not consider a candidate's threshold submission <PRTPAGE P="242"/>until the candidate has submitted candidate certifications that meet the requirements of this section.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Certifications.</E> (1) The candidate shall certify that he or she is seeking nomination by a political party to the Office of President in more than one State. For purposes of this section, in order for a candidate to be deemed to be seeking nomination by a political party to the office of President, the party whose nomination the candidate seeks must have a procedure for holding a primary election, as defined in 11 CFR 9032.7, for nomination to that office. For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">political party</E> means an association, committee or organization which nominates an individual for election to the office of President. The fact that an association, committee or organization qualifies as a political party under this section does not affect the party's status as a national political party for purposes of 2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(1)(B) and 441a(a)(2)(B).</P>
      <P>(2) The candidate and the candidate's authorized committee(s) shall certify that they have not incurred and will not incur expenditures in connection with the candidate's campaign for nomination, which expenditures are in excess of the limitations under 11 CFR part 9035.</P>
      <P>(3) The candidate and the candidate's authorized committee(s) shall certify:</P>
      <P>(i) That they have received matchable contributions totaling more than $5,000 in each of at least 20 States; and</P>
      <P>(ii) That the matchable contributions are from individuals who are residents of the State for which their contributions are submitted.</P>
      <P>(iii) A maximum of $250 of each individual's aggregate contributions will be considered as matchable contributions for the purpose of meeting the thresholds of this section.</P>
      <P>(iv) For purposes of this section, contributions of an individual who maintains residences in more than one State may only be counted toward the $5,000 threshold for the State from which the earliest contribution was made by that contributor.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Threshold submission.</E> To become eligible to receive matching payments, the candidate shall submit documentation of the contributions described in 11 CFR 9033.2(b)(3) to the Commission for review. The submission shall follow the format and requirements of 11 CFR 9036.1.</P>

      <SECTNO>§ 9033.3</SECTNO>
      <SUBJECT>Expenditure limitation certification.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) If the Commission makes an initial determination that a candidate or the candidate's authorized committee(s) have knowingly and substantially exceeded the expenditure limitations at 11 CFR part 9035 prior to that candidate's application for certification, the Commission may make an initial determination that the candidate is ineligible to receive matching funds.</P>
      <P>(b) The Commission will notify the candidate of its initial determination, in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(b). The candidate may submit, within 20 calendar days after service of the Commission's notice, written legal or factual materials, in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.10(b), demonstrating that he or she has not knowingly and substantially exceeded the expenditure limitations at 11 CFR part 9035.</P>
      <P>(c) A final determination of the candidate's ineligibility will be made by the Commission in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(c).</P>
      <P>(d) A candidate who receives a final determination of ineligibility under 11 CFR 9033.3(c) shall be ineligible to receive matching fund payments under 11 CFR 9034.1.</P>

    <SECTION>
      <SECTNO>§ 9033.4</SECTNO>
      <SUBJECT>Matching payment eligibility threshold requirements.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) The Commission will examine the submission made under 11 CFR 9033.1 and 9033.2 and either—</P>
      <P>(1) Make a determination that the candidate has satisfied the minimum contribution threshold requirements under 11 CFR 9033.2(c); or</P>

      <P>(2) Make an initial determination that the candidate has failed to satisfy the matching payment threshold requirements. The Commission will notify the candidate of its initial determination in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(b). The candidate may, within 30 calendar days <PRTPAGE P="243"/>after service of the Commission's notice, satisfy the threshold requirements or submit in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.10(b) written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that he or she has satisfied those requirements. A final determination by the Commission that the candidate has failed to satisfy threshold requirements will be made in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(c).</P>
      <P>(b) The Commission will make its examination and determination under this section as soon as practicable. During the Presidential election year, the Commission will generally complete its review and make its determination within 15 business days.</P>

    <SECTION>
      <SECTNO>§ 9033.5</SECTNO>
      <SUBJECT>Determination of ineligibility date.</SUBJECT>
      <P>The candidate's date of ineligibility shall be whichever date by operation of 11 CFR 9033.5 (a), (b), or (c) occurs first. After the candidate's date of ineligibility, he or she may only receive matching payments to the extent that he or she has net outstanding campaign obligations as defined in 11 CFR 9034.5.</P>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">Inactive candidate.</E> The ineligibility date shall be the day on which an individual ceases to be a candidate because he or she is not actively conducting campaigns in more than one State in connection with seeking the Presidential nomination. This date shall be the earliest of—</P>
      <P>(1) The date the candidate publicly announces that he or she will not be actively conducting campaigns in more than one State; or</P>
      <P>(2) The date  the candidate notifies the Commission by letter that he or she is not actively conducting campaigns in more than one State; or</P>
      <P>(3) The date which the Commission determines under 11 CFR 9033.6 to be the date that the candidate is not actively seeking election in more than one State.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Insufficient votes.</E> The ineligibility date shall be the 30th day following the date of the second consecutive primary election in which such individual receives less than 10 percent of the number of popular votes cast for all candidates of the same party for the same office in that primary election, if the candidate permitted or authorized his or her name to appear on the ballot, unless the candidate certifies to the Commission at least 25 business days prior to the primary that he or she will not be an active candidate in the primary involved.</P>
      <P>(1) The Commission may refuse to accept the candidate's certification if it determines under 11 CFR 9033.7 that the candidate is an active candidate in the primary involved.</P>
      <P>(2) For purposes of this paragraph, if the candidate is running in two primary elections in different States on the same date, the highest percentage of votes the candidate receives in any one State will govern. Separate primary elections held in more than one State on the same date are not deemed to be consecutive primaries. If two primary elections are held on the same date in the same State (e.g., a primary to select delegates to a national nominating convention and a primary for the expression of preference for the nomination of candidates for election to the office of President), the highest percentage of votes a candidate receives in either election will govern. If two or more primaries are held in the same State on different dates, the earliest primary will govern.</P>
      <P>(3) If the candidate certifies that he or she will not be an active candidate in a particular primary, and the Commission accepts the candidate's certification, the primary involved shall not be counted in determining the candidate's date of ineligibility under paragraph (b) of this section, regardless of the percentage of popular votes cast for the candidate in that primary.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">End of matching payment period.</E> The ineligibility date shall be the last day of the matching payment period for the candidate as specified in 11 CFR 9032.6.</P>
      <P>(d) <E T="03">Reestablishment of eligibility.</E> If the Commission has determined that a candidate is ineligible under 11 CFR 9033.5 (a) or (b), the candidate may reestablish eligibility to receive matching funds under 11 CFR 9033.8.<PRTPAGE P="244"/>
      </P>

    <SECTION>
      <SECTNO>§ 9033.6</SECTNO>
      <SUBJECT>Determination of inactive candidacy.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Commission may, on the basis of the factors listed in 11 CFR 9033.6(b) below, make a determination that a candidate is no longer actively seeking nomination for election in more than one State. Upon a final determination by the Commission that a candidate is inactive, that candidate will become ineligible as provided in 11 CFR 9033.5.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Factors considered.</E> In making its determination of inactive candidacy, the Commission may consider, but is not limited to considering, the following factors:</P>
      <P>(1) The frequency and type of public appearances, speeches, and advertisements;</P>
      <P>(2) Campaign activity with respect to soliciting contributions or making expenditures for campaign purposes;</P>
      <P>(3) Continued employment of campaign personnel or the use of volunteers;</P>
      <P>(4) The release of committed delegates;</P>
      <P>(5) The candidate urges his or her delegates to support another candidate while not actually releasing committed delegates;</P>
      <P>(6) The candidate urges supporters to support another candidate.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial determination.</E> The Commission will notify the candidate of its initial determination in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(b) and will advise the candidate of the date on which active campaigning in more than one State ceased. The candidate may, within 15 business days after service of the Commission's notice, submit in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.10(b) written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that he or she is actively campaigning in more than one State.</P>
      <P>(d) <E T="03">Final determination.</E> A final determination of inactive candidacy will be made by the Commission in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(c).</P>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
      <SECTNO>§ 9033.7</SECTNO>
      <SUBJECT>Determination of active candidacy.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) Where a candidate certifies to the Commission under 11 CFR 9033.5(b) that he or she will not be an active candidate in an upcoming primary, the Commission may, nevertheless, on the basis of factors listed in 11 CFR 9033.6(b), make an initial determination that the candidate is an active candidate in the primary involved.</P>
      <P>(b) The Commission will notify the candidate of its initial determination within 10 business days of receiving the candidate's certification under 11 CFR 9033.5(b) or, if the timing of the activity does not permit notice during the 10 day period, as soon as practicable following campaign activity by the candidate in the primary state. The Commission's initial determination will be made in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(b). Within 10 business days after service of the Commission's notice the candidate may submit, in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.10(b), written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that he or she is not an active candidate in the primary involved.</P>
      <P>(c) A final determination by the Commission that the candidate is active will be made in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(c).</P>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
      <SECTNO>§ 9033.8</SECTNO>
      <SUBJECT>Reestablishment of eligibility.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">Candidates found to be inactive.</E> A candidate who has become ineligible under 11 CFR 9033.5(a) on the basis that he or she is not actively campaigning in more than one State may reestablish eligibility for matching payments by submitting to the Commission evidence of active campaigning in more than one State. In determining whether the candidate has reestablished eligibility, the Commission will consider, but is not limited to considering, the factors listed in 11 CFR 9033.6(b). The day the Commission determines to be the day the candidate becomes active again will be the date on which eligibility is reestablished.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Candidates receiving insufficient votes.</E> A candidate determined to be ineligible under 11 CFR 9033.5(b) by failing to obtain the required percentage of votes in two consecutive primaries may have his or her eligibility reestablished if the candidate receives at least 20 percent of the total number of votes cast for candidates of the same party <PRTPAGE P="245"/>for the same office in a primary election held subsequent to the date of the election which rendered the candidate ineligible.</P>
      <P>(c) The Commission will make its determination under 11 CFR 9033.8 (a) or (b) without requiring the individual to reestablish eligibility under 11 CFR 9033.1 and 2. A candidate whose eligibility is reestablished under this section may submit, for matching payment, contributions received during ineligibility. Any expenses incurred during the period of ineligibility that would have been considered qualified campaign expenses if the candidate had been eligible during that time may be defrayed with matching payments.</P>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
      <SECTNO>§ 9033.9</SECTNO>
      <SUBJECT>Failure to comply with disclosure requirements or expenditure limitations.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) If the Commission receives information indicating that a candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) has knowingly and substantially failed to comply with the disclosure requirements of 2 U.S.C. 434 and 11 CFR part 104, or that a candidate has knowingly and substantially exceeded the expenditure limitations at 11 CFR part 9035, the Commission may make an initial determination to suspend payments to that candidate.</P>
      <P>(b) The Commission will notify the candidate of its initial determination in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(b). The candidate will be given an opportunity, within 20 calendar days after service of the Commission's notice, to comply with the above cited provisions or to submit in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.10(b) written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that he or she is not in violation of those provisions.</P>
      <P>(c) Suspension of payments to a candidate will occur upon a final determination by the Commission to suspend payments. Such final determination will be made in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(c).</P>
      <P>(d) (1) A candidate whose payments have been suspended for failure to comply with reporting requirements may become entitled to receive payments if he or she subsequently files the required reports and pays or agrees to pay any civil or criminal penalties resulting from failure to comply.</P>
      <P>(2) A candidate whose payments are suspended for exceeding the expenditure limitations shall not be entitled to receive further matching payments under 11 CFR 9034.1.</P>

      <SECTNO>§ 9033.10</SECTNO>
      <SUBJECT>Procedures for initial and final determinations.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Commission will follow the procedures set forth in this section when making an initial or final determination based on any of the following reasons.</P>
      <P>(1) The candidate has knowingly and substantially exceeded the expenditure limitations of 11 CFR part 9035 prior to the candidate's application for certification, as provided in 11 CFR 9033.3;</P>
      <P>(2) The candidate has failed to satisfy the matching payment threshold requirements, as provided in 11 CFR 9033.4;</P>
      <P>(3) The candidate is no longer actively seeking nomination in more than one state, as provided in 11 CFR 9033.6;</P>
      <P>(4) The candidate is an active candidate in an upcoming primary despite the candidate's assertion to the contrary, as provided in 11 CFR 9033.7;</P>
      <P>(5) The Commission receives information indicating that the candidate has knowingly and substantially failed to comply with the disclosure requirements or exceeded the expenditure limits, as provided in 11 CFR 9033.9; or</P>
      <P>(6) The Commission receives information indicating that substantial assets of the candidate's authorized committee have been undervalued or not included in the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations or that the amount of outstanding campaign obligations has been otherwise overstated in relation to committee assets, as provided in 11 CFR 9034.5(g).</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial determination.</E> If the Commission makes an initial determination that a candidate may not receive matching funds for one or more of the reasons indicated in 11 CFR 9033.10(a), the Commission will notify the candidate of its initial determination. The notification will give the legal and factual reasons for the determination and advise the candidate of the evidence on <PRTPAGE P="246"/>which the Commission's initial determination is based. The candidate will be given an opportunity to comply with the requirements at issue or to submit, within the time provided by the relevant section as referred to in 11 CFR 9033.10(a), written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that the candidate has satisfied those requirements. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Final determination.</E> The Commission will consider any written legal or factual materials timely submitted by the candidate before making its final determination. A final determination that the candidate has failed to satisfy the requirements at issue will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons for the Commission's action. This statement will explain the legal and factual reasons underlying the Commission's determination and will summarize the results of any investigation upon which the determination is based.</P>
      <P>(d) <E T="03">Effect on other determinations.</E> If the Commission makes an initial determination under this section, but decides to take no further action at that time, the Commission may use the legal and factual bases on which the initial determination was based in any future repayment determination under 11 CFR part 9038 or 9039. A determination by the Commission under this section may be independent of any Commission decision to institute an enforcement proceeding under 2 U.S.C. 437g.</P>
      <P>(e) <E T="03">Petitions for rehearing.</E> Following a final determination under this section, the candidate may file a petition for rehearing in accordance with 11 CFR 9038.5(a).</P>

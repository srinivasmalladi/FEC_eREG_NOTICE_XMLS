The factors set forth at 11 CFR 100.5 (g)(2), (3) and (4) shall be used to determine whether entities are affiliated for purposes of this paragraph.</P>

      <P>(f) <E T="03">Method of facilitating the making of contributions</E> means the manner in which the contributions are received or collected such as, but not limited to, payroll deduction or checkoff systems, other periodic payment plans, or return envelopes enclosed in a solicitation request.</P>
      <P>(g) <E T="03">Method of soliciting voluntary contributions</E> means the manner in which the solicitation is undertaken including, but not limited to, mailings, oral requests for contributions, and hand distribution of pamphlets.</P>

(The solicitable class of a membership organization, cooperative, corporation without capital stock or trade association, as described in 11 CFR 114.7 and 114.8, may include some persons who are not considered part of the organization's restricted class, and may exclude some persons who are in the restricted class.)</P>

    <SECTION>
      <SECTNO>§ 114.2</SECTNO>
      <SUBJECT>Prohibitions on contributions and expenditures.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) National banks and corporations organized by authority of any law of Congress are prohibited from making a contribution, as defined in 11 CFR 114.1(a), in connection with any election to any political office, including local, State and Federal offices, or in connection with any primary election or political convention or caucus held to select candidates for any political office, including any local, State or Federal office. National banks and corporations organized by authority of any law of Congress are prohibited form making expenditures as defined in 11 FR 114.1(a) for communications to those outside the restricted class expressly advocating the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate(s) or the candidates of a clearly identified political party, with respect to an election to any political office, including any local, State or Federal office.</P>
      <P>(1) Such national banks and corporations may engage in the activities permitted by 11 CFR part 114, except to the extent that such activity is foreclosed by provisions of law other than the Act.</P>
      <P>(2) The provisions of 11 CFR part 114 apply to the activities of a national bank, or a corporation organized by any law of Congress, in connection with local, State and Federal elections.</P>
      <P>(b)(1) Any corporation whatever or any labor organization is prohibited from making a contribution as defined in 11 CFR part 100, subpart B. Any corporation whatever or any labor organization is prohibited from making a contribution as defined in 11 CFR 114.1(a) in connection with any Federal election.</P>
      <P>(2) Except as provided at 11 CFR 114.10, corporations and labor organizations are prohibited from:</P>
      <P>(i) Making expenditures as defined in 11 CFR part 100, subpart D;</P>
      <P>(ii) Making expenditures with respect to a Federal election (as defined in 11 CFR 114.1(a)), for communications to those outside the restricted class that expressly advocate the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate(s) or the candidates of a clearly identified political party; or</P>
      <P>(iii) Making payments for an electioneering communication to those outside the restricted class. However, this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) shall not apply to State party committees and State candidate committees that incorporate under 26 U.S.C. 527(e)(1), provided that:</P>
      <P>(A) The committee is not a political committee as defined in 11 CFR 100.5;</P>
      <P>(B) The committee incorporated for liability purposes only;</P>
      <P>(C) The committee does not use any funds donated by corporations or labor organizations to make electioneering communications; and</P>
      <P>(D) The committee complies with the reporting requirements for electioneering communications at 11 CFR part 104.</P>

      <P>(c) Disbursements by corporations and labor organizations for the election-related activities described in 11 CFR 114.3 and 114.4 will not cause those activities to be contributions or expenditures, even when coordinated with any candidate, candidate's agent, candidate's authorized committee(s) or any party committee to the extent permitted in those sections. Coordination beyond that described in 11 CFR 114.3 and 114.4 shall not cause subsequent activities directed at the restricted class to be considered contributions or expenditures. However, such coordination <PRTPAGE P="209"/>may be considered evidence that could negate the independence of subsequent communications to those outside the restricted class by the corporation, labor organization or its separate segregated fund, and could result in an in-kind contribution. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 100.16 regarding independent expenditures and coordination with candidates.</P>
      <P>(d) A candidate, political committee, or other person is prohibited from knowingly accepting or receiving any contribution prohibited by this section.</P>
      <P>(e) No officer or director of any corporation or any national bank, and no officer of any labor organization shall consent to any contribution or expenditure by the corporation, national bank, or labor organization prohibited by this section.</P>
      <P>(f) <E T="03">Facilitating the making of contributions.</E> (1) Corporations and labor organizations (including officers, directors or other representatives acting as agents of corporations and labor organizations) are prohibited from facilitating the making of contributions to candidates or political committees, other than to the separate segregated funds of the corporations and labor organizations. Facilitation means using corporate or labor organization resources or facilities to engage in fundraising activities in connection with any federal election, such as activities which go beyond the limited exemptions set forth in 11 CFR part 100, subparts B and C, part 100, subparts D and E, 114.9(a) through (c) and 114.13. A corporation does not facilitate the making of a contribution to a candidate or political committee if it provides goods or services in the ordinary course of its business as a commercial vendor in accordance with 11 CFR part 116 at the usual and normal charge.</P>
      <P>(2) Examples of facilitating the making of contributions include but are not limited to—</P>
      <P>(i) Fundraising activities by corporations (except commercial vendors) or labor organizations that involve—</P>
      <P>(A) Officials or employees of the corporation or labor organization ordering or directing subordinates or support staff (who therefore are not acting as volunteers) to plan, organize or carry out the fundraising project as a part of their work responsibilities using corporate or labor organization resources, unless the corporation or labor organization receives advance payment for the fair market value of such services;</P>
      <P>(B) Failure to reimburse a corporation or labor organization within a commercially reasonable time for the use of corporate facilities described in 11 CFR 114.9(d) in connection with such fundraising activities;</P>
      <P>(C) Using a corporate or labor organization list of customers, clients, vendors or others who are not in the restricted class to solicit contributions or distribute invitations to the fundraiser, unless the corporation or labor organization receives advance payment for the fair market value of the list;</P>
      <P>(D) Using meeting rooms that are not customarily made available to clubs, civic or community organizations or other groups; or</P>
      <P>(E) Providing catering or other food services operated or obtained by the corporation or labor organization, unless the corporation or labor organization receives advance payment for the fair market value of the services;</P>
      <P>(ii) Providing materials for the purpose of transmitting or delivering contributions, such as stamps, envelopes addressed to a candidate or political committee other than the corporation's or labor organization's separate segregated fund, or other similar items which would assist in transmitting or delivering contributions, but not including providing the address of the candidate or political committee;</P>
      <P>(iii) Soliciting contributions earmarked for a candidate that are to be collected and forwarded by the corporation's or labor organizations's separate segregated fund, except to the extent such contributions also are treated as contributions to and by the separate segregated fund; or</P>
      <P>(iv) Using coercion, such as the threat of a detrimental job action, the threat of any other financial reprisal, or the threat of force, to urge any individual to make a contribution or engage in fundraising activities on behalf of a candidate or political committee.</P>

      <P>(3) Facilitating the making of contributions does not include the following activities if conducted by a separate segregated fund—<PRTPAGE P="210"/>
      </P>
      <P>(i) Any activity specifically permitted under 11 CFR 110.1, 110.2, or 114.5 through 114.8, including soliciting contributions to a candidate or political committee, and making in kind contributions to a candidate or political committee; and</P>
      <P>(ii) Collecting and forwarding contributions earmarked to a candidate in accordance with 11 CFR 110.6.</P>
      <P>(4) Facilitating the making of contributions also does not include the following activities if conducted by a corporation or labor organization—</P>
      <P>(i) Enrolling members of a corporation's or labor organization's restricted class in a payroll deduction plan or check-off system which deducts contributions from dividend or payroll checks to make contributions to the corporation's or labor organization's separate segregated fund or an employee participation plan pursuant to 11 CFR 114.11;</P>

      <P>(ii) Soliciting contributions to be sent directly to candidates if the solicitation is directed to the restricted class, <E T="03">see</E> 11 CFR 114.1(a)(2)(i); and</P>
      <P>(iii) Soliciting contributions earmarked for a candidate that are to be collected and forwarded by the corporation's or labor organization's separate segregated fund, to the extent such contributions also are treated as contributions to and by the separate segregated fund.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Disbursements for communications to the restricted class in connection with a Federal election.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Corporations and labor organizations may make communications on any subject, including communications containing express advocacy, to their restricted class or any part of that class. Corporations and labor organizations may also make the communications permitted under 11 CFR 114.4 to their restricted class or any part of that class. The activities permitted under this section may involve election-related coordination with candidates and political committees. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 100.16 and 114.2(c) regarding independent expenditures and coordination with candidates.</P>
      <P>(2) Incorporated membership organizations, incorporated trade associations, incorporated cooperatives and corporations without capital stock may make communications to their restricted class, or any part of that class as permitted in paragraphs (a)(1) and (c) of this section.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Reporting communications containing express advocacy.</E> Disbursements for communications expressly advocating the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate(s) made by a corporation, including a corporation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or labor organization to its restricted class shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 100.134(a) and 104.6.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Communications containing express advocacy.</E> Communications containing express advocacy which may be made to the restricted class include, but are not limited to, the examples set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.</P>
      <P>(1) <E T="03">Publications.</E> Printed material expressly advocating the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate(s) or candidates of a clearly identified political party may be distributed by a corporation or by a labor organization to its restricted class, provided that:</P>
      <P>(i) The material is produced at the expense of the corporation or labor organization; and</P>
      <P>(ii) The material constitutes a communications of the views of the corporation or the labor organization, and is not the republication or reproduction, in whole or in part, of any broadcast, transcript or tape or any written, graphic, or other form of campaign materials prepared by the candidate, his or her campaign committees, or their authorized agents. A corporation or labor organization may, under this section, use brief quotations from speeches or other materials of a candidate that demonstrate the candidate's position as part of the corporation's or labor organization's expression of its own views.</P>
      <P>(2) <E T="03">Candidate and party appearances.</E> (i) A corporation may allow a candidate, candidate's representative or party representative to address its restricted class at a meeting, convention <PRTPAGE P="211"/>or other function of the corporation, but is not required to do so. A labor organization may allow a candidate or party representative to address its restricted class at a meeting, convention, or other function of the labor organization, but is not required to do so. A corporation or labor organization may bar other candidates for the same office or a different office and their representatives, and representatives of other parties addressing the restricted class. A corporation or labor organization may allow the presence of employees outside the restricted class of the corporation or labor organization who are necessary to administer the meeting, other guests of the corporation or labor organization who are being honored or speaking or participating in the event, and representatives of the news media.</P>
      <P>(ii) The candidate, candidate's representative or party representative may ask for contributions to his or her campaign or party, or ask that contributions to the separate segregated fund of the corporation or labor organization be designated for his or her campaign or party. The incidental solicitation of persons outside the corporation's or labor organization's restricted class who may be present at the meeting as permitted by this section will not be a violation of 11 CFR part 114. The candidate's representative or party representative (other than an officer, director or other representative of a corporation or official, member or employee of a labor organization) or the candidate, may accept contributions before, during or after the appearance at the meeting, convention or other function of the corporation or labor organization.</P>
      <P>(iii) The corporation or labor organization may suggest that members of its restricted class contribute to the candidate or party committee, but the collection of contributions by any officer, director or other representative of the corporation or labor organization before, during, or after the appearance while at the meeting, is an example of a prohibited facilitation of contributions under 11 CFR 114.2(f).</P>
      <P>(iv) If the corporation or labor organization permits more than one candidate for the same office, or more than one candidate's representative or party representative, to address its restricted class, and permits the news media to cover or carry an appearance by one candidate or candidate's representative or party representative, the corporation or labor organization shall also permit the news media to cover or carry the appearances by the other candidate(s) for that office, or the other candidates' representatives or party representatives. If the corporation or labor organization permits a representative of the news media to cover or carry a candidate or candidate's representative or party representative appearance, the corporation or labor organization shall provide all other representatives of the news media with equal access for covering or carrying that appearance. Equal access is provided by—</P>
      <P>(A) Providing advance information regarding the appearance to the representatives of the news media whom the corporation or labor organization customarily contacts and other representatives of the news media upon request; and</P>
      <P>(B) Allowing all representatives of the news media to cover or carry the appearance, through the use of pooling arrangements if necessary.</P>
      <P>(3) <E T="03">Phone banks.</E> A corporation or a labor organization may establish and operate phone banks to communicate with its restricted class, urging them to register and/or vote for a particular candidate or candidates, or to register with a particular political party.</P>
      <P>(4) <E T="03">Registration and get-out-the-vote drives.</E> A corporation or a labor organization may conduct registration and get-out-the-vote drives aimed at its restricted class. Registration and get-out-the-vote drives include providing transportation to the place of registration and to the polls. Such drives may include communications containing express advocacy, such as urging individuals to register with a particular party or to vote for a particular candidate or candidates. Information and other assistance regarding registering or voting, including transportation and other services offered, shall not be withheld or refused on the basis of support for or <PRTPAGE P="212"/>opposition to particular candidates, or a particular political party.</P>

Any communications which a corporation or labor organization may make to the general public under paragraph (c) of this section may also be made to the corporation's or labor organization's restricted class and to other employees and their families. Communications which a corporation or labor organization may make only to its employees (including its restricted class) and their families, but not to the general public, are found in paragraph (b) of this section. Communications which a corporation or labor organization may make only to its restricted class are found at 11 CFR 114.3. The activities permitted under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may involve election-related coordination with candidates and political committees only to the extent permitted by this section. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 100.16 and 114.2(c) regarding independent expenditures and coordination with candidates.

Other guests of the corporation who are being honored or speaking or participating in the event and representatives of the news media may be present. A corporation may bar all candidates, candidates' representatives and representatives of political parties from addressing or meeting its restricted class and other employees of the corporation and their families on corporate premises or at any meeting, convention or other function of the corporation.</P>

      <P>(ii) If a Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate or candidate's representative is permitted to address or meet employees, all candidates for that office who are seeking the nomination or election, and who meet pre-established objective criteria under 11 CFR 110.13(c), and who request to appear must be given a similar opportunity to appear;</P>
      <P>(iii) If representatives of a political party are permitted to address or meet employees, representatives of all political parties which had a candidate or candidates on the ballot in the last general election or which are actively engaged in placing or will have a candidate or candidates on the ballot in the next general election and who request to appear must be given a similar opportunity to appear;</P>

      <P>(iv) The candidate's representative or party representative (other than an officer, director or other representative of a corporation) or the candidate, may ask for contributions to his or her campaign or party, or ask that contributions to the separate segregated fund of the corporation be designated for his or her campaign or party. The candidate, candidate's representative or party representative shall not accept contributions before, during or after the appearance while at the meeting, convention or other function of the corporation, but may leave campaign materials or envelopes for members of the audience.

      <P>(v) A corporation or its separate segregated fund shall not, in conjunction with any candidate, candidate representative or party representative appearance under this section, expressly advocate the election or defeat of any clearly identified candidate(s) or candidates of a clearly identified political party and shall not promote or encourage express advocacy by employees;</P>
      <P>(vi) No candidate, candidate's representative or party representative shall be provided with more time or a substantially better location than other candidates, candidates' representatives or party representatives who appear, unless the corporation is able to demonstrate that it is clearly impractical to provide all candidates, candidates' representatives and party representatives with similar times or locations;</P>
      <P>(vii) Coordination with each candidate, candidate's agent, and candidate's authorized committee(s) may include discussions of the structure, format and timing of the candidate appearance and the candidate's positions on issues, but shall not include discussions of the candidate's plans, projects, or needs relating to the campaign; and</P>
      <P>(viii) Representatives of the news media may be allowed to be present during a candidate, candidate representative or party representative appearance under this section, in accordance with the procedures set forth at 11 CFR 114.3(c)(2)(iv).</P>

      <P>(i) The candidate's representative or party representative (other than an official, member or employee of a labor organization) or the candidate, may ask for contributions to his or her campaign or party, or ask that contributions to the separate segregated fund of the labor organization be designated for his or her campaign or party. The candidate, candidate's representative or party representative shall not accept contributions before, during or after the appearance while at the meeting, convention or other function of the labor organization, but may leave campaign materials or envelopes for members of the audience. No official, member, or employee of a labor organization or its separate segregated fund shall, either orally or in writing, solicit or direct or control contributions by members of the audience to any candidate or party representative under this section, and shall not facilitate the making of contributions to any such candidate or party.

The general public includes anyone who is not in the corporation's or labor organization's restricted class. The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section shall not prevent a qualified nonprofit corporation under 11 CFR 114.10(c) from including express advocacy in any communication made to the general public under paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(5)(i) of this section.</P>

      <P>(5) <E T="03">Voter guides.</E> A corporation or labor organization may prepare and distribute to the general public voter guides consisting of two or more candidates' positions on campaign issues, including voter guides obtained from a nonprofit organization which is described in 26 U.S.C. 501 (c)(3) or (c)(4), provided that the voter guides comply with either paragraph (c)(5)(i) or (c)(5)(ii) (A) through (E) of this section.

      <SECTNO>§ 114.5</SECTNO>
      <SUBJECT>Separate segregated funds.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">Voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund.</E> (1) A separate segregated fund is prohibited from making a contribution or expenditure by utilizing money or anything of value secured by physical force, job discrimination, financial reprisals, or the threat of force, job discrimination, or financial reprisal; or by dues, fees, or other monies required as a condition of membership in a labor organization or as a condition of employment or by monies <PRTPAGE P="217"/>obtained in any commercial transaction. For purposes of this section, fees or monies paid as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership or employment are monies required as a condition of membership or employment even though they are refundable upon request of the payor.</P>
      <P>(2) A guideline for contributions may be suggested by a corporation or a labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either, provided that the person soliciting or the solicitation informs the persons being solicited—</P>
      <P>(i) That the guidelines are merely suggestions; and</P>
      <P>(ii) That an individual is free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggest and the corporation or labor organization will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of their contribution or their decision not to contribute.</P>
      <FP>A corporation or labor organization or the separate segregated fund of either may not enforce any guideline for contributions.</FP>
      <P>(3) Any person soliciting an employee or member for a contribution to a separate segregated fund must inform such employee or member of the political purposes of the fund at the time of the solicitation.</P>
      <P>(4) Any persons soliciting an employee or member for a contribution to a separate segregated fund must inform the employee or member at the time of such solicitation of his or her right to refuse to so contribute without any reprisal.</P>
      <P>(5) Any written solicitation for a contribution to a separate segregated fund which is addressed to an employee or member must contain statements which comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) of this section, and if a guideline is suggested, statements which comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of treasury monies.</E> Corporations, labor organizations, membership organizations, cooperatives, or corporations without capital stock may use general treasury monies, including monies obtained in commercial transactions and dues monies or membership fees, for the establishment, administration, and solicitation of contributions to its separate segregated fund. A corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may not use the establishment, administration, and solicitation process as a means of exchanging treasury monies for voluntary contributions.</P>
      <P>(1) A contributor may not be paid for his or her contribution through a bonus, expense account, or other form of direct or indirect compensation.</P>
      <P>(2) A corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may, subject to the provisions of 39 U.S.C. 3005 and chapter 61, title 18, United States Code, utilize a raffle or other fundraising device which involves a prize, so long as State law permits and the prize is not disproportionately valuable. Dances, parties, and other types of entertainment may also be used as fundraising devices. When using raffles or entertainment to raise funds, a reasonable practice to follow is for the separate segregated fund to reimburse the corporation or labor organization for costs which exceed one-third of the money contributed.</P>
      <P>(3) If the separate segregated fund pays any solicitation or other administrative expense from its own account, which expense could be paid for as an administrative expense by the collecting agent, the collecting agent may reimburse the separate segregated fund no later than 30 calendar days after the expense was paid by the separate segregated fund.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Membership in separate segregated funds.</E> (1) A separate segregated fund established by a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may provide that persons who contribute a certain amount to its separate segregated fund will become <E T="03">members</E> of its separate segregated fund, so long as—</P>
      <P>(i) The fund accepts contributions of all amounts, subject to the limitations of part 110;</P>
      <P>(ii) Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, nothing of value may be given in return for or in the course of membership;</P>

      <P>(iii) The fund may use membership status for intangible privileges such as <PRTPAGE P="218"/>allowing members only to choose the candidates to whom the fund will contribute.</P>

      <P>(2) The fact that the separate segregated fund of a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock is a <E T="03">membership group</E> does not provide the corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock with any greater right of communication or solicitation than the corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock is otherwise granted under this part.</P>
      <P>(d) <E T="03">Control of funds.</E> A corporation, membership organization, cooperative, corporation without capital stock, or labor organization may exercise control over its separate segregated fund.</P>
      <P>(e) <E T="03">Disclosure.</E> Separate segregated funds are subject to the following disclosure requirements:</P>
      <P>(1) A corporation or labor organization is not required to report any payment made or obligation incurred which is not a contribution or expenditure, as defined in § 114.1(a), except those reporting requirements specifically set forth in this section.</P>
      <P>(2) A membership organization or corporation is not required to report the cost of any communication to its members or stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, if such membership organization or corporation is not organized primarily for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any person to Federal office, except that—</P>
      <P>(i) The costs incurred by a membership organization, including a labor organization, or by a corporation, directly attributable to a communication expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate (other than a communication primarily devoted to subjects other than the express advocacy of the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate) shall, if those costs exceed $2,000 per election, be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 100.134(a); and</P>
      <P>(ii) The amounts paid or incurred for legal or accounting services rendered to or on behalf of a candidate or political committee solely for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Act or chapter 95 or 96 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 paid by a corporation or labor organization which is the regular employer of the individual rendering such services, shall be reported in accordance with the provisions of part 104.</P>
      <P>(3) A separate segregated fund is subject to all other disclosure requirements of political committees as set forth in part 104.</P>
      <P>(f) <E T="03">Contribution limits.</E> Separate segregated funds are subject to the contribution limitations for political committees set forth in part 110. (See particularly § 110.3).</P>
      <P>(g) <E T="03">Solicitations.</E> Except as specifically provided in §§ 114.6, 114.7, and 114.8, a corporation and/or its separate segregated fund or a labor organization and/or its separate segregated fund is subject to the following limitations on solicitations:</P>
      <P>(1) A corporation or a separate segregated fund established by a corporation is prohibited from soliciting contributions to such fund from any person other than its stockholders and their families and its executive or administrative personnel and their families. A corporation may solicit the executive or administrative personnel of its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates and their families. For purposes of this section, the factors set forth at 11 CFR 100.5(g)(4) shall be used to determine whether an organization is an affiliate of a corporation.</P>
      <P>(2) A labor organization, or a separate segregated fund established by a labor organization is prohibited from soliciting contributions to such a fund from any person other than its members and executive or administrative personnel, and their families.</P>
      <P>(h) <E T="03">Accidental or inadvertent solicitation.</E> Accidental or inadvertent solicitation by a corporation or labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either, of persons apart from and beyond those whom it is permitted to solicit will not be deemed a violation, provided that such corporation or labor organization or separate segregated fund has used its best efforts to comply with the limitations regarding the persons it may solicit and that the method of solicitation is corrected <PRTPAGE P="219"/>forthwith after the discovery of such erroneous solicitation.</P>
      <P>(i) <E T="03">Communications paid for with voluntary contributions.</E> A separate segregated fund may, using voluntary contributions, communicate with the general public, except that such communications may not solicit contributions to a separate segregated fund established by a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock, unless such solicitation is permitted under paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
      <P>(j) <E T="03">Acceptance of contributions.</E> A separate segregated fund may accept contributions from persons otherwise permitted by law to make contributions.</P>

Such method shall be made available on the written request of the labor organization and at a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the expenses incurred thereby. For example—</P>
      <P>(1) If a corporation, including its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates utilizes a payroll deduction plan, check-off system, or other plan which deducts contributions from the dividend or payroll checks of stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, the corporation shall, upon written request of the labor organization, make that method available to members of the labor organization working for the corporation, its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates, who wish to contribute to the separate segregated fund of the labor organization representing any members working for the corporation, or any of its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates.

      <P>(4) If a corporation uses no method to solicit voluntary contributions or to facilitate the making of voluntary contributions from stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, it is not required by law to make any method available to the labor organization for its members.

      <P>(c) <E T="03">Written solicitation.</E> A solicitation under this section may be made only by mail addressed to stockholders, executive or administrative personnel, or employees at their residences. All written solicitations must inform the recipient—</P>
      <P>(1) Of the existence of the custodial arrangement described hereinafter;</P>
      <P>(2) That the corporation, labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either cannot be informed of persons who do not make contributions; and</P>
      <P>(3) That persons who, in a calendar year make a single contribution of $50 or less, or multiple contributions aggregating $200 or less may maintain their anonymity by returning their contributions to the custodian.</P>
      <P>(d) <E T="03">The custodial arrangement.</E> In order to maintain the anonymity of persons who do not wish to contribute and of persons who wish to respond with a single contribution of $50 or less, or multiple contributions aggregating $200 or less in a calendar year, and to satisfy the recordkeeping provisions, the corporation, labor organization, or separate segregated fund of either shall establish a custodial arrangement for collecting the contributions under this section.</P>
      <P>(1) The custodian for a separate segregated fund established by a corporation shall not be a stockholder, officer, executive or administrative personnel, or employee of the corporation, or an officer, or employee of its separate segregated fund. The custodian for a separate segregated fund established by a labor organization shall not be a member, officer or employee of the labor organization or its separate segregated fund.</P>

The custodian must provide this information within a reasonable time prior to the reporting date of the fund under part 104;</P>
      <P>(iii) Periodically forward all funds in the separate account, by check drawn on that account, to the separate segregated fund; and</P>
      <P>(iv) Treat all funds which appear to be illegal in accordance with the provisions of § 103.3(b).</P>
      <P>(3) The custodian shall not—</P>

      <P>(i) Make the records of persons making a single contribution of $50 or less, or multiple contributions aggregating $200 or less, in a calendar year, available to any person other than representatives of the Federal Election Commission or the Secretary of the <PRTPAGE P="221"/>Senate, as appropriate, and law enforcement officials or judicial bodies.</P>
      <P>(ii) Provide the corporation or labor organization or the separate segregated fund of either with any information pertaining to persons who, in a calendar year, make a single contribution of $50 or less or multiple contributions aggregating $200 or less except that the custodian may forward to the corporation, labor organization or separate segregated fund of either the total number of contributions received; or</P>
      <P>(iii) Provide the corporation, labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either with any information pertaining to persons who have not contributed.</P>
      <P>(4) The corporation, labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either shall provide the custodian with a list of all contributions, indicating the contributor's identification and amount contributed, which have been made directly to the separate segregated fund by any person within the group of persons solicited under this section.</P>
      <P>(5) Notwithstanding the prohibitions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the custodian may be employed by the separate segregated fund as its treasurer and may handle all of its contributions, provided that the custodian preserves the anonymity of the contributors as required by this section. The custodian shall file the required reports with the Federal Election Commission or the Secretary of the Senate, as appropriate. A custodian who serves as treasurer is subject to all of the duties, responsibilities, and liabilities of a treasurer under the Act, and may not participate in the decision making process whereby the separate segregated fund makes contributions and expenditures.</P>
      <P>(e) <E T="03">Availability of methods.</E> (1) A corporation or labor organization or the separate segregated fund of either may not use a payroll deduction plan, a check-off system, or other plan which deducts contributions from an employee's paycheck as a method of facilitating the making of contributions under this section.</P>
      <P>(2) The twice yearly solicitation may only be used by a corporation or labor organization to solicit contributions to its separate segregated fund and may not be used for any other purpose.</P>
      <P>(3) A corporation is required to make available to a labor organization representing any members working for the corporation or its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates the method which the corporation uses to solicit employees under this section during any calendar year.</P>
      <P>(i) If the corporation uses a method to solicit any employees under this section, the corporation is required to make that method available to the labor organization to solicit the employees of the corporation who are not represented by that labor organization, and the executive or administrative personnel and the stockholders of the corporation and their families.</P>

      <P>(ii) If the corporation does not wish to disclose the names and addresses of stockholders or employees, the corporation shall make the names and addresses of stockholders and employees available to an independent mailing service which shall be retained to make the mailing for <E T="03">both</E> the corporation and the labor organization for any mailings under this section.</P>
      <P>(iii) If the corporation makes no solicitation of employees under this section during the calendar year, the corporation is not required to make any method or any names and addresses available to any labor organization.</P>
      <P>(4) The corporation shall notify the labor organization of its intention to make a solicitation under this section during a calendar year and of the method it will use, within a reasonable time prior to the solicitation, in order to allow the labor organization opportunity to make a similar solicitation.</P>

      <P>(5) If there are several labor organizations representing members employed at a single corporation, its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates, the labor organizations, either singularly or jointly, may not make a combined total of more than two written solicitations per calendar year. A written solicitation may contain a request for contributions to each separate fund established by the various <PRTPAGE P="222"/>labor organizations making the combined mailing.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Trade associations.</SUBJECT>
      <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> A trade association is generally a membership organization of persons engaging in a similar or related line of commerce, organized to promote and improve business conditions in that line of commerce and not to engage in a regular business of a kind ordinarily carried on for profit, and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any member.<PRTPAGE P="223"/>
      </P>
      <P>(b) <E T="03">Prohibition.</E> Nothing in this section waives the prohibition on contributions by corporations which are members of a trade association.</P>
      <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> A trade association or a separate segregated fund established by a trade association may solicit contributions from the stockholders and executive or administrative personnel of the member corporations of such trade association and the families of such stockholders and personnel if—</P>
      <P>(1) The member corporation involved has separately and specifically approved the solicitations; and</P>
      <P>(2) The member corporation has not approved a solicitation by any other trade association for the same calendar year.</P>
      <P>(d) <E T="03">Separate and specific approval.</E> (1) The member corporation must knowingly and specifically approve any solicitation for a trade association, whether the solicitation is done by the trade association, its separate segregated fund, or the corporation or any of its personnel, for contributions to the trade association's separate segregated fund.</P>
      <P>(2) A copy of each approved request received by a trade association or its separate segregated fund shall be maintained by the trade association or its fund for three years from the year for which the approval is given.</P>
      <P>(3) The request for approval may contain a copy of solicitation materials which will be used if approval is granted. Such a mailing must specifically indicate the requirement of approval and the limitation of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and approval must be granted to the trade association or its separate segregated fund prior to the time any solicitation is made of the stockholders or executive or administrative personnel by the trade association, its separate segregated fund, or by the corporation for contributions to the separate segregated fund of the trade association. (The request for approval may be sent to the representatives of the corporation with whom the trade association normally conducts the association's activities.)</P>
      <P>(4) A separate authorization specifically allowing a trade association to solicit its corporate member's stockholders, and executive or administrative personnel applies through the calendar year for which it is designated. A separate authorization by the corporate member must be designated for each year during which the solicitation is to occur. This authorization may be requested and may also be received prior to the calendar year in which the solicitation is to occur.</P>
      <P>(5) In its request to a member corporation, a trade association may indicate that it intends to solicit, for example, a limited class of the executive or administrative personnel of the member corporation, or only the executive or administrative personnel but not the stockholders of the member corporation. Moreover, in its approval, a member corporation may similarly limit any solicitation by the trade association or its separate segregated fund. In any event, a member corporation, once it has approved any solicitation—even to a limited extent—of its personnel or stockholders by a trade association or its separate segregated fund, is precluded from approving any such solicitation by another trade association or its separate segregated fund and the corporation and its personnel are precluded from soliciting the corporation's executive or administrative personnel or stockholders on behalf of another trade association or its separate segregated fund.</P>
      <P>(e) <E T="03">Solicitation.</E> (1) After a trade association has obtained the approval required in paragraph (c) of this section, there is no limit on the number of times the trade association or its separate segregated fund may solicit the persons approved by the member corporation during the calendar year to which the approval applies. The member corporation may, however, in its approval limit the number of times solicitations may be made.</P>
      <P>(2) A member corporation which grants permission to a trade association to solicit is in no way restricted in its rights under § 114.5(g) to solicit its stockholders or executive or administrative personnel and their families for contributions to the corporation's own separate segregated fund.</P>

      <P>(3) There is no limitation on the method of soliciting voluntary contributions or the method of facilitating the making of voluntary contributions <PRTPAGE P="224"/>which a trade association may use. The member corporation may not use a payroll deduction or checkoff system for executive or administrative personnel contributing to the separate segregated fund of the trade association.</P>
      <P>(4) A trade association and/or its separate segregated fund is subject to the provisions of § 114.5(a).</P>
      <P>(f) <E T="03">Solicitation of a subsidiary corporation.</E> If a parent corporation is a member of the trade association but its subsidiary is not, the trade association or its separate segregated fund may only solicit the parent's executive or administrative personnel and their families and the parent's stockholders and their families; it may not solicit the subsidiary's executive or administrative personnel or stockholders or their families. If a subsidiary is a member of the trade association but the parent corporation is not, the trade association or its separate segregated fund may only solicit the subsidiary's executive or administrative personnel and their families and the subsidiary's stockholders and their families; it may not solicit the parent's executive or administrative personnel or stockholders or their families. If both parent and subsidiary are members of the trade association, the executive or administrative personnel and their families and the stockholders and their families of each may be solicited.</P>
      <P>(g) <E T="03">Federations of trade associations.</E> (1) A federation of trade associations is an organization representing trade associations involved in the same or allied line of commerce. Such a federation may, subject to the following limitations, solicit the members of the federation's regional, State or local affiliates or members, provided that all of the political committees established, financed, maintained or controlled by the federation and its regional, State, or local affiliates or members are considered one political committee for the purposes of the limitations in §§ 110.1 and 110.2. The factors set forth at §100.5(g)(4) shall be used to determine whether an entity is a regional, State or local affiliate of a federation of trade associations.</P>
      <P>(i) The federation and its member associations may engage in a joint solicitation; or</P>
      <P>(ii) The member association may delegate its solicitation rights to the federation.</P>
      <P>(2) A federation is subject to the provisions of this section when soliciting the stockholders and executive or administrative personnel of the corporate members of its member associations.</P>
      <P>(h) <E T="03">Communications other than solicitations.</E> A trade association may make communications, other than solicitations, to its members and their families under the provisions of § 114.3. When making communications to a member which is a corporation, the trade association may communicate with the representatives of the corporation with whom the trade association normally conducts the association's activities.</P>
      <P>(i) <E T="03">Trade association employees.</E> (1) A trade association may communicate with its executive or administrative personnel and their families under the provisions of § 114.3; a trade association may communicate with its other employees under the provisions of § 114.4.</P>
      <P>(2) A trade association may solicit its executive or administrative personnel and their families under the provisions of § 114.5(g); a trade association may solicit its other employees under the provisions of § 114.6.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Employee participation plans.</SUBJECT>

      <P>(a) A corporation may establish and administer an employee participation plan (i.e. a <E T="03">trustee plan</E>) which is a political giving program in which a corporation pays the cost of establishing and administering separate bank accounts for any employee who wishes to participate. The cost of administering and establishing includes the payment of costs for a payroll deduction or check-off plan and the cost of maintaining the separate bank accounts.</P>
      <P>(1) The employees must exercise complete control and discretion over the disbursement of the monies in their accounts.</P>
      <P>(2) The trustee, bank, or other administrator shall not provide the corporation or its separate segregated fund any report of the source or recipient of any contribution(s) or donation(s) into or out of any account or of the amount any employee has in an account.</P>
      <P>(3) The trustee, bank, or other administrator may provide the corporation or its separate segregated fund with a periodic report limited to information about the total number of employees in the program, the total number of funds in all the accounts combined, and the total amount of contributions made to all candidates and committees combined.</P>
      <P>(4) No stockholder, director, or employee of the corporation or its separate segregated fund may exert pressure of any kind to induce participation in the program.</P>
      <P>(5) No stockholder, director, or employee of the corporation or its separate segregated fund may exercise any direction or control, either oral or written, over contributions by participants in the program to any candidate, group of candidates, political party, or other person.</P>
      <P>(b) An employee participation plan must be made available to all employees including members of a labor organization who are employees of the corporation. Communications about participation in the plan may be conducted by either the corporation or the labor organization or both.</P>
      <P>(c) A labor organization may establish and administer an employee participation plan subject to the above provisions, except that the cost shall be borne by the labor organization.</P>
      <P>(d) The method used to transmit employee or member contributions to the candidate or political committee may not in any manner identify the corporation or labor organization which established the employee particiption plan.</P>

      <SUBJECT>Incorporation of political committees; payment of fringe benefits.</SUBJECT>

      <P>(a) An organization may incorporate and not be subject to the provisions of this part if the organization incorporates for liability purposes only, and <PRTPAGE P="229"/>if the organization is a political committee as defined in 11 CFR 100.5. Notwithstanding the corporate status of the political committee, the treasurer of an incorporated political committee remains personally responsible for carrying out their respective duties under the Act.</P>
      <P>(b) [Reserved]</P>
      <P>(c)(1) A corporation of labor organization may not pay the employer's share of the cost of fringe benefits, such as health and life insurance and retirement, for employees or members on leave-without-pay to participate in political campaigns of Federal candidates. The separate segregated fund of a corporation or a labor organization may pay the employer's share of fringe benefits, and such payment would be a contribution in-kind to the candidate. An employee or member may, out of unreimbursed personal funds, assure the continuity of his or her fringe benefits during absence from work for political campaigning, and such payment would not be a contribution in-kind.</P>
      <P>(2) Service credit for periods of leave-without-pay is not considered compensation for purposes of this section if the employer normally gives identical treatment to employees placed on leave-without-pay for nonpolitical purposes.</P>

      <P>(b) Persons who accept funds given, disbursed, donated or otherwise provided by a corporation or labor organization shall not:</P>

      <P>(d)(1) Persons who receive funds from a corporation or a labor organization that do not meet the exceptions of paragraph (c) of this section must be able to demonstrate through a reasonable accounting method that no such funds were used to pay any portion of an electioneering communication.</P>

      <P>(2) Any person who wishes to pay for electioneering communications may, but is not required to, establish a segregated bank account into which it deposits only funds donated or otherwise provided by individuals, as described in 11 CFR part 104.

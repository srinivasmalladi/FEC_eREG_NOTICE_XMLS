        <P>The final rules that are the subject of these corrections were published as part of a continuing series of regulations the Commission promulgated implementing the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93-579, 88 Stat. 1896 (1974), the Government in the Sunshine Act of 1976, Public Law 94-409, 90 Stat. 1241 (1976), the Freedom of Information Act of 1966, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552, and the Federal Election Campaign Act (&#x201C;FECA&#x201D;) of 1971, as amended, 2 U.S.C. 431,<E T="03">et seq.</E>Because these corrections are merely technical, this is not a substantive rule requiring notice and comment under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. Under the &#x201C;good cause&#x201D; exception to the notice and comment requirements, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3), these corrections are effective upon publication. Thus, the corrected final rules are effective January 4, 2010.</P>

        <P>The Commission is correcting an inadvertent duplication of language in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, governing expenditures by delegates for public political advertising that refers to candidates for public office.
